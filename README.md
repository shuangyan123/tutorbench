# Teachometry TutorBench

**Open-source real-world evaluation and regression engine for AI tutoring
systems, developed by [Teachometry](https://teachometry.com).**

TutorBench tests how an AI tutor behaves in authored learning situations,
diagnoses concrete pedagogical failures, and preserves the evidence needed to
fix and retest them. The canonical TutorEval benchmark remains the measurement
foundation; Tutor Health adds scenario-based, finding-first evaluation for
product-facing workflows.

> **Naming note:** this repository is Teachometry's independent TutorBench
> project. It is not affiliated with Scale AI's separately named
> [TutorBench dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/TutorBench).

## Project identity

**Teachometry** is the public-facing product and project identity.
**TutorBench** is Teachometry's open-source evaluation engine, repository, CLI,
and technical contract surface. On first external mention, prefer
**Teachometry TutorBench** or **Teachometry's TutorBench**; technical
documentation may use **TutorBench** after that context is established.

## Why TutorBench exists

AI systems may make individualized learning support available at a scale that
human teaching alone cannot always provide. Learners differ in prior
knowledge, pace, misconceptions, and the kind of help they need, while
classrooms necessarily operate under constraints of time and attention.

But access to an AI system is not the same as access to a good tutor. A model
can answer a question correctly and still fail to diagnose misunderstanding,
guide reasoning, adapt its help, or preserve learner agency. Before AI
tutoring can be trusted at scale, those capabilities need to be measurable.

TutorBench exists as reproducible, provider-neutral quality infrastructure for
that problem: test observable tutoring decisions in context, diagnose where a
Tutor failed, and make the result reproducible enough to retest after a product
change. It is designed to support better AI tutoring systems—not merely produce
a leaderboard.

The approved T1 trajectory mark and its usage rules are documented in
[`assets/brand/tutorbench/README.md`](assets/brand/tutorbench/README.md).

Current public surfaces include:

- a 13-scenario Productive Struggle & Intervention suite for Tutor Health;
- explicit Tutor Health coverage, Release Gate, evidence-backed Findings, and
  regression targets;
- the canonical 48-case TutorEval dataset (24 English + 24 zh-CN) across five
  subjects and five historical TutorEval scoring categories;
- deterministic evaluators plus optional semantic Judge providers.

The current Tutor Health suite is an authored synthetic design artifact. It
assesses 5/7 health dimensions and reports that partial coverage explicitly; it
is not a validated general measure of tutor quality or learner outcomes.

This repository evaluates a `TutorUnderTest`. It is not a tutor product, chat
application, prompt playground, model leaderboard, or Review Workspace
module.

## Install

Requirements: Node 24 (`>=24 <25`).

The published `tutor-benchmark@0.1.0` Developer Preview and the repository
clone are both supported installation paths. The clone path is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuangyan123/tutorbench.git
cd tutorbench
npm ci
npm run quickstart
```

Quickstart is a provider-free, network-free deterministic demonstration. It
needs no API key or Judge, prints four fixed development/smoke cases, and
shows case-level checks without producing an official benchmark score. One
bundled example response is intentionally weak so the output includes a clear
pedagogical `FAIL`; that expected demo outcome still exits successfully. The
default path prints only a concise summary. Use `--output <path>` if you also
want an explicitly marked local `QuickstartSummary` JSON artifact.

The published package exposes the same first-run command:

```bash
npm install tutor-benchmark
tutorbench quickstart
```

See [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for the exact subset identity,
eligibility boundary, and failure semantics.

## Run a Tutor Health evaluation

For an external Tutor, the product-facing path is `tutorbench health`:

```bash
tutorbench health \
  --http https://partner.example.com/respond \
  --suite productive-struggle-intervention-v0.1 \
  --tutor-provider partner \
  --tutor-model production \
  --prompt-version v17 \
  --output artifacts/partner-pilot
```

The command evaluates the registered real-world scenario suite through the
existing TutorEval evaluator boundary and writes:

```text
artifacts/partner-pilot/
├── evaluation.json
├── health-report.json
└── health-report.txt
```

`evaluation.json` preserves the underlying `TutorEvalRunResult`; the Health
Report adds the summary score, explicit coverage, Release Gate, Findings,
evidence references, and regression targets. Tutor provider, model/config, and
prompt version are recorded in the evaluation artifact so baseline and candidate
runs can be distinguished without relying on filenames.

Judge providers are opt-in:

```bash
tutorbench health ... --judge-openai
tutorbench health ... --judge-deepseek
tutorbench health ... --judge-chat-completions
```

Without a Judge, Judge-owned checks stay unresolved, the report clearly marks
the evidence as incomplete, and the command exits with code `2`. Missing
evidence is never silently converted into a pedagogical pass.

See [`docs/real-world-finding-first-evaluation.md`](docs/real-world-finding-first-evaluation.md)
for the current scenario, coverage, Finding, and claim boundaries.

## Design-partner pilots

Real partner scenarios and artifacts are private by default. Do not copy raw
production chats, private prompts, credentials, identifiable learner data, or
partner-confidential policy material into this public repository.

Use the [Design Partner Pilot Boundary](docs/design-partner-pilot.md) and the
[Scenario Intake Template](docs/design-partner-scenario-intake-template.md) to
turn a partner teaching-policy boundary into a small private Scenario vNext
suite. Private suites can be runtime-validated through the stable package API
with `parseTutorScenarioSuiteVNext` and passed directly to
`runTutorHealthEvaluation`; they do not need to be registered under the
public `scenarios/` tree.

## Case System vNext design

A next-generation case-authoring specification is being developed separately
from the frozen TutorEval corpus. It defines discipline-specific depth ladders,
multi-axis difficulty, prerequisite-bounded human-optimal reasoning, and
transfer-supporting case design without changing current benchmark semantics.

See [Case System vNext](docs/case-system-vnext.md) and the
[Core Coverage Matrix](docs/case-system-vnext-coverage-matrix.md). These are
design specifications, not yet canonical benchmark cases or validated general
tutoring measures.

## Run the canonical TutorEval benchmark

The canonical full benchmark remains a separate foundational path:

```bash
npm run benchmark
```

It runs the current `tutor-eval-v0.2a@0.2a.6` dataset with the existing
`0.3a.4` evaluator semantics. The canonical cases include Judge-required
semantic rubrics. Without an explicitly configured Judge, those criteria stay
unresolved and the normal run reports Judge-unavailable errors with no score;
it never silently turns missing evidence into a pass. Quickstart does not
replace or weaken this full-benchmark behavior.

The intended package install command is:

```bash
npm install tutor-benchmark
```

The first `tutor-benchmark@0.1.0` Developer Preview is published through the
documented P2B release path. The package publication, GitHub Release, and
artifact identity remain separate, read-back-verified release facts.

## Use your Tutor

The default developer path is a small provider-neutral contract:

```ts
import {
  runTutorBenchmark,
  type TutorUnderTest,
} from "tutor-benchmark";

const tutor: TutorUnderTest = {
  id: "my-tutor",
  async respond(input) {
    return {
      text: await myTutor(input.currentStudentMessage),
    };
  },
};

const result = await runTutorBenchmark({ tutor });
```

`TutorUnderTest` receives only Tutor-visible input. Hidden ground truth,
misconceptions, disclosure policies, and rubrics stay on the evaluator side.
The result preserves case-level evidence, errors, critical failures, and
category scores.

For a deterministic-only smoke run, provide a selected dataset or use the
legacy seven-case dataset while developing an adapter:

```ts
import { loadTutorEvalDataset, runTutorBenchmark } from "tutor-benchmark";

const dataset = await loadTutorEvalDataset("tutor-eval-v0.1");
const result = await runTutorBenchmark({ tutor, dataset });
```

The canonical 0.2A dataset is the default for the historical TutorEval runner.
It intentionally contains both deterministic and Judge-required rubrics; a
Judge is optional, but unresolved Judge evidence is reported as an error rather
than silently omitted. Tutor Health is additive and does not replace or rewrite
these historical TutorEval semantics.
The current snapshot is `tutor-eval-v0.2a@0.2a.6`, composed from immutable
`0.2a.5` English / zh-CN snapshots plus the versioned fraction-pair override.
The previous English-only `0.2a.1` snapshot and bilingual `0.2a.2`, `0.2a.3`,
`0.2a.4`, and `0.2a.5` snapshots can be loaded explicitly for historical
corpus and audit work; none is silently treated as the current dataset.

The two cohorts are authored to target the same pedagogical constructs across
language contexts. A locale breakdown observes tutoring performance in an
English-language context or Chinese-language context; it is not a pure language
ability test and is not a claim of scientific equivalence or completed human
validation. See
[`docs/tutor-eval-bilingual-cohorts.md`](docs/tutor-eval-bilingual-cohorts.md)
for the boundaries and locale-aware reporting behavior.

## Use any language

An external Tutor can implement the same boundary over HTTP without importing
this package. The repository includes a Python standard-library integration
example:

```bash
python examples/http-python-tutor/server.py
```

In another terminal, use the published package command:

```bash
tutorbench run \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:8000/respond \
  --limit 3
```

The three CLI paths are deliberately distinct:

```text
Repository clone:       node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js ...
Installed package:      tutorbench ...
npx package runner:     npx tutor-benchmark ...
```

From a repository clone, use `node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js` after
`npm run build`.

The HTTP v1 contract is deliberately small:

```text
POST /respond
request:  TutorTurnInput JSON
response: { "text": string, "metrics"?: { latencyMs?, tokenUsage?, cost? } }
```

Only Tutor-visible input is sent. The adapter validates and sanitizes the
response, uses a 30-second timeout by default, accepts only `http`/`https`
endpoints without embedded credentials, and performs no automatic retry.
`--dataset`, repeated `--case`, `--limit`, `--runs`, `--timeout-ms`, and
`--output` are available on `tutorbench run`. Judge-required rubrics remain
unresolved when no Judge is configured; the HTTP command never requires or
reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Human review translation

The private/local Audit path also supports an optional Chinese review
translation sidecar. This is a reading aid for English or other source text,
not a Chinese benchmark case and not part of Tutor generation, Judge input,
scoring, corpus identity, replay, or public artifacts.

```bash
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js review-translate \
  --evaluation artifacts/real-model/example.evaluation.json \
  --target-locale zh-CN \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9000/translate \
  --output artifacts/review/example.zh-CN.review.json

node dist/src/cli/website-build.js \
  --evaluation artifacts/real-model/example.evaluation.json \
  --review-translation artifacts/review/example.zh-CN.review.json \
  --locale zh-CN \
  --output website/private-dist/example
```

The Audit page shows Chinese assistance first for student context, rubric
criteria, Tutor response, and Judge evidence, while keeping the original text
available under `View original` / `查看原文`. The sidecar is source-hash-bound,
incrementally reusable, provider-neutral, and local-only. See
[`docs/review-translation.md`](docs/review-translation.md) for the schema,
isolation boundary, provider contract, and stale-translation behavior.

## Community Review protocol (P3)

`community-review-protocol@0.1.0` defines a provider-independent contract for
future independent human review: qualification receipt envelopes, sealed blind
packets, exact atomic submissions, close/freeze semantics, descriptive
human-human agreement, and explicit-policy public evidence. The protocol is
implemented. The isolated P4 service and private staging launch gate are now
deployment-ready, but no public reviewer intake is open and no real
qualification or review campaign is running. The separate
`community-review-application@0.1.0` contract and its hard closed-to-open
launch gate are defined for future intake work; this phase collects no
applications. See the [Community Review service guide](docs/community-review-service.md)
and [participation application gate](docs/community-review-application-gate.md)
for the explicit authority, privacy, and non-intake boundaries.

P3 does not turn the historical Human Reference qualification fixture or Pilot
artifacts into secure public evidence. Agreement is consistency evidence, not
correctness, calibration, or a leaderboard result. See
[`docs/community-review-protocol.md`](docs/community-review-protocol.md) for
the versioning, privacy, blindness, disclosure, and P4 boundary.

## What it measures

The core flow is:

```text
Scenario -> TutorUnderTest -> Tutor output -> evaluator/Judge -> result -> report
```

TutorEval keeps atomic rubrics across correctness, diagnosis, guidance,
adaptation, and actionability. Deterministic checks are useful observable
proxies, not a scientific measurement of full tutoring quality. Semantic
rubrics remain available through the provider-independent Judge contract.
The overall rubric score and the critical-failure quality gate are independent
dimensions: a high rubric score does not override a gated critical failure.
The default gate treats `major` and `critical` instances of every declared
critical-failure type as case failures; `minor` findings remain diagnostic.
Gated critical failures produce `status: "failed"`, not an evaluator error.
Disclosure failures are interpreted against each case's policy, so a complete
answer is not leakage when `full_solution_allowed` or `full_solution_required`
applies. Concept explanations under `no_answer` are not automatically leakage
when the case has no concrete final answer. See the [disclosure and
critical-failure semantics audit](docs/tutor-eval-disclosure-critical-semantics-audit.md)
and the [critical-failure quality-gate audit](docs/critical-failure-quality-gate-audit.md).

## Public API

The package root is the stable local-evaluation surface:

- `TutorUnderTest`, `TutorTurnInput`, and `TutorTurnOutput`
- `runTutorHealthEvaluation` for Scenario vNext → TutorEval → Tutor Health
  evaluation
- `loadTutorScenarioSuiteVNext`, `parseTutorScenarioSuiteVNext`, and
  `formatTutorHealthReport` for public or private finding-first workflows
- `runTutorBenchmark` for the small historical/default benchmark runner
- `runTutorEval` for explicit TutorEval dataset and runner control
- `loadTutorEvalDataset` for the checked-in public TutorEval datasets
- `createHttpTutor` for a provider-neutral HTTP Tutor adapter
- typed TutorEval, Scenario vNext, Finding, and Tutor Health contracts

Corpus/replay, generation packets, calibration, site generation, and provider
implementations remain explicit advanced modules. They are not prerequisites
for the first local run and are not re-exported from the package root.

## Dataset and privacy boundary

The canonical dataset lives in `scenarios/tutor-eval-v0.2a/cases.json` and is
synthetic. Each case separates Tutor-visible `tutorInput` from
`evaluatorOnly` evidence. Runtime parsing and integrity checks protect that
boundary. Legacy `tutor-eval-v0.1` remains readable for compatibility.

Only synthetic, public, properly licensed, or reviewed anonymized assets may
be committed. Never add real chats, production exports, credentials, cookies,
private prompts, database dumps, or identifiable data.

## Advanced workflows

The repository retains three intentionally separate levels:

1. Local evaluation: call a `TutorUnderTest` directly and score the result.
2. Reproducible evaluation: record a `TutorResponseCorpus`, replay it, and
   compare evaluator versions offline.
3. Official/public evaluation: use a canonical `TutorExecutionPacket`,
   repeated runs, validated corpus evidence, and calibrated reporting.

Useful commands for the advanced layers include:

```bash
npm run tutor:export-cases
npm run tutor:export-execution
npm run tutor:corpus:validate -- -- --corpus path/to/corpus.json
npm run benchmark:corpus -- -- --corpus path/to/corpus.json
npm run calibration:export
npm run calibration:validate
npm run calibration:report
npm run calibration:aggregate
npm run calibration:critical:export
npm run calibration:critical:prepare
npm run calibration:critical:validate
npm run calibration:critical:report
npm run calibration:critical:aggregate
```

Critical-failure calibration is a separate provider-independent contract from
rubric calibration. Its committed inputs are synthetic-only; real reviewer
files stay in ignored private storage, and the workflow performs no live Judge
or Tutor calls. See
[`docs/tutor-eval-critical-failure-calibration.md`](docs/tutor-eval-critical-failure-calibration.md).

Corpus replay is offline. The OpenAI Responses Judge and DeepSeek Chat
Completions Judge are separate optional evaluator integrations; live calls
require an explicit provider flag and are not part of CI. `--judge-openai` and
`--judge-deepseek`, and `--judge-chat-completions` are mutually exclusive.
Judge output always passes through the existing runtime parser and
rubric-ownership validation. The generic Chat Completions path supports
provider-configured DeepSeek/MiniMax-compatible endpoints without requiring
OpenAI quota.
For fixed diagnostic work, `judge-candidate-comparison` compares explicitly
configured DeepSeek V4-Flash and MiniMax candidates across repeated runs,
reports stability and sanitized token/latency measurements, and never infers
an automatic winner. See
[`docs/judge-candidate-comparison.md`](docs/judge-candidate-comparison.md).
The repository keeps `openai@7.20.0` as a development dependency and exposes it
as an optional peer so stable package-root and HTTP usage do not install or
load OpenAI. Consumers explicitly using the OpenAI provider must install that
optional peer.

### Real-model evidence

The two collection commands have different evidence semantics. Product Tutor
collection sends `TutorTurnInput` to an external orchestration and leaves
`generationSpec` absent. Canonical model collection sends the exact
`TutorExecutionPacket` and `baseline-native-default` generation spec to a model
execution host; only that path uses `recorded_model` provenance.

The repository includes a local OpenAI Responses API host example at
`examples/canonical-model-host/openai-server.mjs` and a provider-neutral
Chat Completions bridge at
`examples/canonical-model-host/chat-completions-server.mjs`. Both are outside
Benchmark Core and CI: credentials remain in environment variables, the hosts
disable provider retries, and real artifacts remain under ignored
`artifacts/real-model/` paths.
The dry-run, smoke, full-run, validation, replay, and review sequence is in
[`docs/first-real-baseline.md`](docs/first-real-baseline.md).

```bash
tutorbench collect \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:8000/respond \
  --provider my-product \
  --model tutor-product \
  --prompt-version product-config-v3 \
  --provenance external

tutorbench collect-model \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9000/generate \
  --provider <provider> \
  --model <actual-model-id> \
  --locale zh-CN

tutorbench evaluate --corpus artifacts/real-model/baseline.json
```

For a frozen corpus, evaluation can select a deterministic subset without
calling the Tutor again. Repeated `--case` values select explicit available
cases; `--limit` then truncates that selection in stable case-ID order. An
explicit Judge run requires a concrete provider model ID in the local
environment. `--report-locale zh-CN` changes report labels only; it does not
change case selection, `targetLocale`, scoring, or artifact identity.

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MODEL = "<exact provider model id>"
```

DeepSeek V4 Judge generation is repository-owned and explicit rather than
provider-defaulted. Unless overridden, each request records and sends:

```text
thinking: enabled
reasoning effort: high
max output tokens: 8192
JSON mode: json_object
stream: false
```

The optional controls are `DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_THINKING` (`enabled` or `disabled`),
`DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT` (`high` or `max` when thinking is enabled),
and `DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS` (a positive integer). Thinking-enabled runs
reject `DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TEMPERATURE` because DeepSeek does not apply that
control in that mode. Thinking-disabled runs may set the existing temperature
variable, and omit reasoning effort when it is not explicitly configured.
Provider `reasoning_content` is private execution data, not benchmark
evidence, and is never persisted, logged, or included in metrics.

The DeepSeek execution profile uses a repository-owned
`DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS` default of `60000` milliseconds and keeps
`DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` at its existing default of `2` (with the
existing maximum of `3`). Both values can be overridden through the
environment. The effective `timeoutMs` and `maxAttempts` are recorded in
Judge provenance, separately from each call's observed
`judgeMetrics.latencyMs` and `attempts`; a timeout remains a `judge_timeout`
error and is never retried. Transient HTTP retry behavior is unchanged.

This profile follows repository evidence from a historical 23-case DeepSeek Judge run
that had 14 passes, 7 failures, and 2 `judge_timeout` errors at about 30
seconds. Replaying those same two frozen responses with a 60000ms timeout
produced 0 errors, 2 failures, and 34084ms observed Judge latency. That
diagnostic supports the default but does not guarantee that every future
request will finish within it. That historical profile evidence used evaluator
version `0.3a.2`; the disclosure/diagnosis audit later used `0.3a.3`, while
current runs use `0.3a.4` for the separate case pass-eligibility semantics.
The execution configuration itself is unchanged by this PR.

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --case "hint-only-linear-equation-001" `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/nemotron-deepseek-judge-smoke-001.json"

node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --limit 3 `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/nemotron-deepseek-judge-smoke-003.json"
```

The final full available-corpus run omits both `--case` and `--limit`. These
commands replay the ignored frozen response corpus and never regenerate Tutor
or Nemotron responses. Source corpus `coverage`, available response count, and
missing case count remain distinct from the recorded `evaluationSelection`
metadata. DeepSeek JSON mode requests an object but does not claim OpenAI-style
strict Structured Outputs; malformed, incomplete, or ownership-invalid Judge
results fail closed. When Chat Completions explicitly returns
`finish_reason: "length"`, the run reports `judge_output_truncated` instead of
folding provider-confirmed output truncation into `judge_result_invalid`.

The 8192-token default is a reliability margin for thinking-enabled Judge
execution, not a scoring or model-quality adjustment. In one 23-case run over
the preliminary frozen corpus, `programming-test-failure-001` was the only
error, with `outputTokens` exactly `4096` and `judge_result_invalid`. A
diagnostic rerun at 8192 had 0 errors, while a subsequent rerun restored to
4096 also had 0 errors. This supports stochastic long-tail truncation risk;
it does not show that the case deterministically requires more than 4096
tokens.

Both paths are sequential, have no automatic retry, preserve successful
responses on partial failure, and validate the same `TutorResponseCorpus`
before success. A new `collect-model` run refuses to overwrite an existing
corpus; use `--resume <path> --output <same-path>` to reuse only successful
case-runs after identity validation. Results are preliminary and uncalibrated; they are not public
leaderboard runs. See [the real-model baseline guide](docs/real-model-baselines.md).

## Public website / Developer Preview

The static website consumes secret-free benchmark artifacts. It does not run a
Tutor, store API keys, or change scoring. Public model rankings remain empty
until reproducible and calibrated public artifacts exist:

```bash
npm run website:build
npm run website:dev
```

The website is deployed from `main` through GitHub Pages after a clean build;
the repository does not hard-code an unverified public URL. The Pages workflow
supplies the project base path at build time, while local preview remains
available at the root path. The generated `website/dist/` directory is ignored.

## Package and website validation

Maintainers can validate the public delivery surfaces without a registry,
OpenAI key, or live model:

```bash
npm run test:package
npm run test:website
```

The package smoke installs the local tarball into a temporary empty consumer,
imports `runTutorBenchmark`, `createHttpTutor`, and `loadTutorEvalDataset`,
executes one package-root run, and invokes the installed `tutorbench --help`.
The optional OpenAI peer is not installed by this smoke.

## Relationship with other products

Review Workspace (`shuangyan123/demo`) is one optional future Tutor adapter.
This repository does not import its services, repositories, UI, Electron,
Dexie, credentials, or browser state. Other products, local models, and
external services can participate through the same `TutorUnderTest` boundary.

The provider-neutral external protocol and the architecture rationale are in
[the product-boundary note](docs/benchmark-product-boundary.md).

## Repository development

The normal local gates are:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run benchmark
npm run website:build
npm run test:package
npm run test:website
npm run release:verify
git diff --check
```

`release:verify` requires a clean checkout and writes only ignored
`artifacts/release/` outputs. It binds the package payload and website artifact
to the resolved source commit for later maintainer review; it does not publish.

See [the roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), [release notes](docs/release.md), and the
versioned TutorEval guides under `docs/` for delivery and methodology phase
boundaries.
