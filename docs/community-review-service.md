P5 Community calibration              NOT STARTED
```

This document describes an isolated service boundary, its production-capable
adapters, and the deployment verification contract. No external deployment,
public reviewer intake, or real campaign was performed in P4-G. L2-C2C adds a
separate closed application-intake boundary; its implementation evidence and
private staging evidence must not be confused with a launch authorization. A
successful P4-G check is deployment-readiness evidence, not evidence that a
real reviewer has qualified or submitted a review.

## P3 and P4 responsibility boundary

P3 remains the provider-independent protocol in `src/community-review/` and
`src/contracts/`. It owns the versioned envelopes, canonical SHA-256
fingerprints, positive-allowlist review packet, exact atomic submissions, and
the pure `SEALED -> OPEN -> CLOSED -> FROZEN` review lifecycle. P3 contracts
and fingerprints were not changed by P4-C or P4-D.

P4 owns the private/runtime boundary around those helpers:

- authenticated-principal mapping to private reviewer accounts and
  service-issued opaque reviewer IDs;
- append-only consent history and current-policy authorization;
- reviewer/operator separation and account lifecycle;
- sealed qualification definitions, material references, pool state, attempts,
  server-side evaluation, and authoritative receipt persistence;
- authenticated blind assignment delivery from sealed review material;
- authenticated own-assignment submission and operator-only close authority;
- exact packet/atomic validation, transaction ordering, uniqueness,
  anti-replay checks, close snapshots, narrow audit metadata, and deterministic
  in-memory behavior for synthetic tests;
- operator-only `CLOSED -> FROZEN` authority bound to the exact persisted P4-E
  close result;
- diagnostic agreement evidence, conservative disclosure decisions, public
  P3-allowlisted artifact generation, and narrow operational audit metadata.

Qualification is an eligibility mechanism. It is not calibration, correctness
validation of a tutor, a Human Reference, consensus, adjudication, a Judge
score, or a leaderboard result.

## Runtime and package boundary

Service-only runtime code lives in:

```text
services/community-review-service/
```

The service has its own `package.json`, lockfile, and `tsconfig.json`. Its build
output is under the service directory and the root package `files` allowlist
remains limited to the public `dist/src/` tree and listed assets. The service
package is private and is not published or exported by
`tutor-benchmark@0.1.0`. PostgreSQL and JOSE dependencies are isolated in the
service package; the root package contract and version remain unchanged.

P4-B remains the authentication boundary: `AuthenticationAdapter` reduces an
external credential to `{ principal: { provider, subject }, channel }`, where
the channel is server-derived and never taken from an HTTP header. The private
mapping resolves the reviewer-channel principal to a stable service-issued
opaque reviewer ID, and the application facade checks account state and
current consent before invoking a reviewer-owned operation.
`OidcJwtAuthenticationAdapter` verifies the configured issuer, exact audience,
profile-specific client binding, required scope, expiry, algorithm, and
signature through a remote JWKS endpoint. Tokens, arbitrary claims, and
provider payloads do not enter the service contract. A complete OIDC channel
policy is required; an absent policy rejects credentials rather than falling
back to subject-only authority. `SyntheticAuthenticationAdapter` is available
only for explicitly selected test/development configurations.

L2-C3B adds private operator-only invitation issuance, reviewer-channel
redemption, one-time digest persistence, and terminal lifecycle transitions.
Redemption creates only an unconsented account/mapping; consent,
qualification, assignment, submission, and evidence remain separate. No OAuth
UI, public reviewer signup, payment flow, or public reviewer/campaign API is
part of this phase. L2-C2C's `POST /v1/applications` transport is a separate
state-gated application path and remains closed by default; no browser form or
CORS exposure is added. Lower-level methods retain opaque reviewer IDs only
for trusted internal transactions.

## L2-C2C closed application-intake boundary

Participation applications are handled by
`CommunityReviewApplicationIntakeService` and its authenticated operator
facade in `src/application-intake.ts`. This service is intentionally not an
extension of reviewer authority. It can submit and withdraw an application,
list pending applications, read operator detail, record `INVITED` or `DECLINED`,
and purge expired records. It cannot provision a reviewer, create consent,
issue qualification receipts, create assignments, submit reviews, mutate a
review batch, or create any P3/P4 evidence record.

The application switch is independent from the historical reviewer/campaign
switch:

```text
COMMUNITY_REVIEW_APPLICATION_INTAKE_STATE=CLOSED | OPEN | PAUSED
COMMUNITY_REVIEW_PUBLIC_INTAKE=false
```

Missing, empty, whitespace-padded, or malformed primitive application-state
configuration resolves to `CLOSED`; unknown non-empty enum values reject
configuration. Production configuration still rejects
`COMMUNITY_REVIEW_PUBLIC_INTAKE=true`. The runtime constructs the application
service with the configured state, so changing `OPEN` to `CLOSED` or `PAUSED`
on a controlled restart stops only new application writes; withdrawal and
authorized operator maintenance remain available.

The HTTP transport is deliberately allowlisted:

```text
POST /v1/applications
POST /v1/applications/:applicationId/withdraw
GET  /v1/operator/applications
GET  /v1/operator/applications/:applicationId
POST /v1/operator/applications/:applicationId/decision
POST /v1/operator/applications/purge
```

Public submission requires `Idempotency-Key`, uses the strict
`community-review-application@0.1.0` parser, rejects oversized or malformed
requests, and returns only a minimal receipt. The first successful response
may include a high-entropy withdrawal credential; retries never return it.
Keys and credentials are not logged or stored raw. Contact information is in
`community_review_application_contacts`, separate from application metadata;
application and audit rows contain no contact value or free text after
withdrawal/purge.

Migration `007_community_review_application_intake.sql` is additive and does
not rewrite migrations `001` through `006`. It creates the application,
contact, idempotency, and narrow audit tables with lifecycle, fingerprint,
version, and retention constraints. The PostgreSQL adapter loads these rows
into the same storage-neutral snapshot validated by the in-memory repository,
locks the new tables in the service transaction order, and persists contact
deletion as a real SQL delete while preserving a minimal tombstone.

The fixed application retention policy is 90 days for pending applications and
30 days after `INVITED` or `DECLINED`. Withdrawal redacts contact and free text
immediately. `purgeExpired(asOf)` is deterministic and operator-authorized;
this phase does not require a background scheduler. The policy is an internal
data-minimization rule, not a legal retention or compliance certification.

## L2-C3B channel and invitation authority

The operator and reviewer channels are independently configured. A production
operator token must match the configured operator audience, access-token
profile, authorized-party/client claim, required `scope`, and provider/subject
allowlist. A reviewer token must match the separate reviewer policy. If the
exact provider profile, client binding, or scope is not configured, OIDC
authentication fails closed. `scope` is authoritative; a present `permissions`
claim is validated structurally but is not treated as an alternate source of
authority.

The invitation switch is independent and defaults to disabled:

```text
COMMUNITY_REVIEW_REVIEWER_INVITATION_STATE=DISABLED | INVITE_ONLY
COMMUNITY_REVIEW_REVIEWER_INVITATION_TTL_MS=60000..2678400000
```

When enabled, the allowlisted operator channel may issue or revoke an opaque
invitation. A reviewer channel may redeem a valid one-time credential before a
principal mapping exists. The raw 32-byte capability is returned only by
issuance; migration `008_reviewer_invitations.sql` stores only its digest and
bounded lifecycle/audit metadata. Redemption atomically creates the private
principal mapping and consumes the invitation. `INVITED` application decisions
do not issue invitations automatically. No invitation endpoint adds CORS or
creates a portal surface.

## Sealed qualification architecture

The active flow is:

```text
authenticated reviewer
  -> provisioned opaque reviewer account
  -> current consent
  -> ACTIVE sealed qualification pool validated against server-side metadata
  -> service-created attempt and one-time nonce
  -> positive allowlist qualification packet
  -> structured responses
  -> private answer-key evaluation inside the service transaction
  -> QUALIFIED or NOT_QUALIFIED attempt
  -> P3 receipt built by the service
  -> persisted authoritative receipt bound to that attempt
```

`QualificationMaterialStore` is the private substitution boundary. It exposes
only `loadVisiblePacket` and `loadPrivateAnswerKey` to trusted service code.
The synthetic `InMemoryQualificationMaterialStore` contains unmistakably
synthetic material for tests. P4-G adds the read-only
`FilesystemQualificationMaterialStore`, which accepts only relative opaque
references, resolves them beneath a configured private root, rejects symlink
escapes and oversized/non-JSON files, and rechecks the definition fingerprint.
The answer key remains behind this interface and is never returned to a
reviewer. No hosted secret store is part of this phase.

The qualification definition is versioned by qualification ID/version, pool
ID/version, full instrument identity, review locale, versioned pass-rule ID,
and the visible item set. The service computes deterministic SHA-256
fingerprints using the same canonical JSON convention as P3. The answer-key
commitment additionally binds the definition, pool, locale, instrument, and
normalized private statuses. Changing visible material, a guide/instrument,
locale, pass rule, or answer key therefore cannot silently retain the same
authority identity.

Historical public qualification fixtures and Pilot material remain
historical/training material. They are not loaded by the P4-C active material
store and are not secure public qualification banks.

## Qualification pool lifecycle

New P4-C pools use:

```text
DRAFT -> SEALED -> ACTIVE -> RETIRED
```

`DRAFT` is private setup and cannot issue attempts. `SEALED` records the
definition fingerprint, visible-item fingerprint, answer-key commitment,
instrument identity, and pass-rule ID; the service does not mutate these
semantic fields afterward. `ACTIVE` permits new attempts. `RETIRED` permits no
new attempts but preserves existing attempt and receipt history. An attempt
that was already issued may finish evaluation after retirement, so retirement
does not rewrite accepted historical authority.

The legacy `OPEN` state is retained only for P4-A synthetic rows already
constructed without the P4-C material commitment. It is not an active P4-C
pool and cannot use the new qualification issuer.

## Persistence model

`003_sealed_qualification_authority.sql` adds the following PostgreSQL design
boundary without rewriting migrations 001 or 002:

| Record | Stored boundary | Important constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qualification_pools` | versioned identity, instrument binding, visible-set fingerprint, opaque material references, private answer-key commitment, lifecycle timestamps | P4-C sealed states require committed metadata; semantic fields are immutable after sealing |
| `qualification_attempts` | reviewer/pool binding, nonce hash, packet binding, structured status projection, evaluation result and timestamps | state/result checks, complete binding checks, pool-wide nonce uniqueness, no raw nonce |
| `qualification_receipts` | exact P3 receipt, attempt/reviewer/pool binding, authority state and issue time | one row per attempt and unique receipt fingerprint; receipt status must be `qualified` |
| `qualification_authority_audit_events` | event type plus opaque reviewer/attempt/pool bindings and reason code | no answer key, raw response, credentials, claims, or private material |

Qualification responses are persisted only as bounded structured status
projections needed for authority and provenance. Optional reviewer evidence is
not persisted by the service. Hidden reasoning, provider payloads, credentials,
cookies, tokens, and raw authentication claims are never part of these records.

The P4-A/P4-B tables remain in the same service boundary: reviewer accounts,
private authentication mappings, append-only consent events, auth audit events,
sealed batch source references, assignments, accepted/rejected submissions,
batch close records, and frozen pools. Their existing P3 identity, uniqueness,
rollback, and `SEALED -> OPEN -> CLOSED -> FROZEN` semantics are unchanged.

## Reviewer-visible qualification packet

The packet is constructed from a dedicated positive allowlist. It contains only
the attempt ID, qualification and pool version, review locale, the four-field
instrument eligibility binding, and visible items consisting of an atomic
identity plus a prompt. It does not serialize an internal definition and then
remove fields.

The packet excludes `expectedStatus`, `expectedAnswer`, `answerKey`, answer-key
commitment, private material references, `reference`, `gold`, consensus,
adjudication, Judge fields, internal notes, scoring rules, other attempts, and
other reviewer data. Runtime serialization tests inspect the actual packet,
not just TypeScript types.

## Attempt lifecycle and response rules

The P4-C persisted lifecycle is:

```text
ISSUED -> SUBMITTED -> QUALIFIED
                    \-> NOT_QUALIFIED
```

`CREATED` is available as a persistence state for a future split create/issue
transaction, while the current service atomically creates and issues one
attempt. Legacy `STARTED`/`REJECTED` records are accepted only as historical
P4-A compatibility data and cannot produce a new P4-C receipt.

Attempt creation requires an authenticated, `ACTIVE` account, current consent,
an `ACTIVE` pool, and matching qualification version, pool version, instrument
fingerprint, and review locale. The reviewer cannot supply an owner identity,
answer key, expected assessment, or result. The service generates the raw
nonce, returns it for that attempt, and persists only its SHA-256 digest.

Responses must be complete and contain exactly one valid status for every
visible atomic identity. Missing, duplicate, extra, wrong-owner, cross-attempt,
or malformed responses are rejected before any attempt mutation. Evidence, if
accepted by the input boundary, is capped at 500 characters and is not a
request for chain-of-thought.

The synthetic default limit is three attempts per reviewer/pool; it is
configurable for a deployment or test. Every issued attempt consumes one slot,
including a failed qualification. Limit checks and inserts run in the same
serialized transaction. Re-submitting an evaluated attempt, replacing its
response, reusing its nonce, or using another reviewer's nonce fails.

The only P4-C pass rule is the versioned deterministic rule
`all-required-items-correct@1`: every submitted status must equal the private
status for the exact visible item set. No percentage, majority vote, Judge,
accuracy, calibration, or reference result is calculated.

## Server-side evaluation and receipt authority

Submission/evaluation follows this order:

```text
lock attempt
-> verify owner, nonce, packet fingerprint, pool/version/locale/instrument
-> load sealed visible material and private answer key
-> verify definition and answer-key commitments
-> validate complete response set
-> persist sanitized response projection
-> derive QUALIFIED or NOT_QUALIFIED with the versioned rule
```

An authoritative receipt is built with the existing
`buildCommunityReviewQualificationReceipt` function only after the same
reviewer-owned attempt is service-evaluated as `QUALIFIED`. It binds the exact
P3 qualification ID/version, pool/version, definition fingerprint, reviewer,
locale, and instrument. The service does not accept a caller-created receipt
or a caller-computed pass result as authority.

P3 protocol validity and P4 service authority remain distinct:

```text
P3-valid receipt
  != automatically service-issued

authoritative receipt
  = P3-valid receipt + evaluated attempt + persisted binding + anti-replay state
```

Receipt issuance is idempotent for the same attempt and exact stored receipt.
A second conflicting fingerprint or attempt binding is rejected. Pool
retirement, later account disablement, or later consent revocation does not
rewrite a previously persisted P3 envelope; those changes affect future
authorization. A receipt authority status, if later revoked operationally,
would be service state outside the immutable P3 content.

## Blind delivery and assignment authority (P4-D)

P4-D turns the P4-A assignment primitives into a service-controlled delivery
boundary. The reviewer-facing path is:

```text
authenticated principal
  -> private reviewer account
  -> ACTIVE account and current consent
  -> service-authoritative P4-C receipt
  -> exact eligibility match
  -> oldest OPEN eligible batch
  -> private visible-task load and fingerprint verification
  -> transactional P3 assignment and positive-allowlist packet
```

The service operation is `getOrCreateOwnEligibleAssignment`. A caller may give
an optional batch ID as an operational hint, but may not supply a qualification
receipt, visible task set, reviewer identity, score, or packet content. The
authenticated application facade resolves the private reviewer account and
passes only its service-issued opaque reviewer ID to the service.

### Sealed material boundary

`ReviewBatchMaterialStore` is the narrow private substitution boundary for
review batches. It receives an opaque sealed-source reference plus the P3
batch identity commitments and returns only
`CommunityReviewVisibleTask[]`. It never receives or returns a reviewer packet
request containing private source material. The deterministic
`InMemoryReviewBatchMaterialStore` is test-only synthetic infrastructure.
P4-G adds the read-only `FilesystemReviewBatchMaterialStore`, which resolves
only relative references beneath the configured private root, limits file
size, rejects path traversal/symlink escapes, parses the positive task
projection, and rechecks the sealed-source and visible-task fingerprints. No
real active campaign or private task bank is committed here.

Before assignment construction, the service verifies the stored batch record,
sealed-source reference, batch fingerprint, instrument identity, review locale,
qualification eligibility, source fingerprint, and visible task-set
fingerprint. It parses the returned positive projection and recomputes the
P3-visible task fingerprint. A missing or mismatched material record fails
closed and rolls back the assignment transaction; the manifest is never
regenerated from caller input.

### Eligibility and deterministic selection

Every assignment requires these independent authorities:

```text
ACTIVE reviewer account
current consent for the active policy
authoritative stored P4-C receipt owned by that reviewer
matching protocol, qualification, pool, definition, instrument, and locale
OPEN batch
one assignment per reviewer and batch
```

The receipt must match the batch's complete qualification binding, not merely a
`qualified` status. Qualification-pool retirement, consent revocation, or
account disablement does not rewrite an already-issued P3 assignment; those
authorities gate new reviewer actions. New assignments require a currently
eligible receipt and an OPEN batch.

When no batch ID is supplied, the service considers only OPEN batches for
which the reviewer passes all receipt checks and selects the oldest batch by
the repository's deterministic creation ordering. A supplied batch ID narrows
the same eligibility check; it does not grant access to an arbitrary hidden
batch. No marketplace, recommender, expected-outcome steering, prior-reviewer
data, or agreement statistic participates in selection.

### Assignment transaction, idempotency, and lifecycle

The in-memory repository serializes the complete operation. The PostgreSQL
adapter executes the same synchronous persistence contract inside one real
SQL transaction: it acquires a fixed service advisory transaction lock, locks
every existing authority row in deterministic table order, loads the typed
snapshot, delegates validation to the existing in-memory transaction
implementation, then persists the committed delta. Migration
`004_blind_delivery_assignment_authority.sql` adds narrow delivery audit
records while preserving the existing database-level
`UNIQUE(batch_id, reviewer_id)` assignment constraint from migration 001.

The same reviewer/batch retry returns the exact persisted assignment and
packet, including stable assignment and packet fingerprints. A withdrawn
assignment cannot be silently replaced. Concurrent duplicate requests are
serialized by the repository and remain subject to the database uniqueness
constraint. Assignment issuance that loses the OPEN-to-CLOSED/FROZEN race
fails without leaving a partial assignment. Existing P3 close and freeze
helpers remain authoritative; P4-E adds the service-owned submission and
close orchestration described below.

Reviewer retrieval and withdrawal are authenticated own-assignment operations.
The application facade derives ownership from the authentication mapping, so a
request cannot substitute another reviewer ID. Retrieval returns the exact
stored positive-allowlist packet and records only a narrow operational event.
Withdrawal changes the P3 assignment state, preserves provenance for close
coverage, requires the authenticated owner and an OPEN batch, and is rejected
after an accepted submission. Account/consent changes gate later actions but
do not delete assignment history.

Delivery audit records contain only event type, opaque batch/assignment/
reviewer IDs where needed, a bounded reason code, and a timestamp. They never
contain packet contents, visible task material, sealed-source data, answer
keys, credentials, tokens, cookies, auth subjects, evaluator fields, or other
reviewer information.

## Production submission and close authority (P4-E)

In this phase, “production” means service-level transaction authority and
replay-safe semantics. It does not mean a deployed endpoint, hosted
PostgreSQL, a production identity provider, public intake, or a real campaign.
The P4-E application facade exposes `submitOwnAssignment` and
`getOwnSubmission` for authenticated reviewers, plus operator-authorized
`closeBatch` and `getBatchCloseResult`.

### Authenticated own-assignment submission

The reviewer path is:

```text
authenticated principal
  -> private opaque reviewer ID
  -> ACTIVE account and current consent
  -> existing owned assigned P4-D assignment
  -> exact persisted P3 packet
  -> exact complete atomic annotations
  -> P3 submission builder
  -> one persisted accepted submission
```

The caller may identify a batch and assignment operationally, but the service
derives reviewer identity from the authentication mapping and checks ownership
against the persisted assignment. An optional packet fingerprint is only a
consistency hint; the authoritative packet is loaded from service persistence.
The service verifies assignment, batch, reviewer, protocol, instrument,
visible-task-set, visible-atomic-ID, qualification-receipt, and packet
bindings before calling `buildCommunityReviewSubmission`.

P3 remains the source of truth for the atomic payload. An accepted submission
contains exactly one annotation for every visible atomic, with the unchanged
status vocabulary:

```text
SATISFIED
OMITTED_OR_INCOMPLETE
EXPLICIT_CONFLICT
```

Missing, duplicate, extra, cross-assignment, cross-batch, invalid-status, and
malformed-evidence payloads fail before an accepted row is committed. Existing
P3 evidence semantics remain in force: optional evidence is non-empty and at
most 500 characters. No chain-of-thought or hidden task material is requested
or persisted.

Submission authorization is checked in the same transaction as the OPEN batch
boundary and accepted-row insert. The account must be `ACTIVE` and have
current consent. An already-issued qualification receipt remains the
assignment's provenance; pool retirement does not silently re-score or
invalidate that assignment during submission. Later account or consent
changes do not rewrite historical accepted evidence.

The persistence authority is:

```text
one assignment -> at most one accepted submission
one batch + reviewer -> at most one accepted submission
one submission fingerprint -> at most one accepted row
```

An identical retry returns the stored submission with the same fingerprint. A
different payload for an already accepted assignment is a
`replacement_submission` rejection and cannot overwrite evidence. Rejected
attempts contain only a bounded reason code, candidate fingerprint when
available, batch/assignment/opaque-reviewer IDs, and a timestamp. Accepted
submission audit events contain only the event type, the same opaque protocol
bindings, the submission fingerprint, and a timestamp; they do not duplicate
annotations or evidence.

### Operator close authority and exact snapshot

Only an authorized operator may close a batch. The close request contains the
batch ID, not caller-supplied assignments or submissions. Within one
transaction the service:

```text
lock the authoritative batch
  -> require OPEN
  -> load all persisted assignments
  -> load all persisted accepted submissions
  -> validate each stored packet/submission binding
  -> call closeCommunityReviewBatch(...)
  -> persist the exact P3 CLOSED manifest and close record
  -> persist the exact accepted-submission snapshot
  -> transition the batch to CLOSED
  -> commit
```

The stored close snapshot is set-checked against the authoritative accepted
rows by assignment ID, opaque reviewer ID, and submission fingerprint. The
P3 close record's coverage and accepted arrays must match that same set. The
service cannot omit an accepted row, inject a caller-created row, or recompute
the result from mutable current input. If P3 rejects incomplete interpretable
coverage or any stored record is inconsistent, the transaction rolls back:
the batch remains `OPEN` and no close record is retained.

After a successful close, repeated `closeBatch` calls and
`getBatchCloseResult` return the exact persisted result, including its stable
close fingerprint and accepted snapshot. The in-memory adapter returns cloned
records, so mutating a returned object cannot mutate authority. PostgreSQL
migration `005_submission_close_authority.sql` adds the relational close
snapshot, accepted-submission audit table, bounded rejection reason constraint,
immutable-record triggers, and batch/assignment/submission guards. The close
record, accepted snapshot, and CLOSED manifest cannot be replaced or reopened
through the service authority.

Reviewer retrieval is limited to the authenticated reviewer's own accepted
submission. Operator close-result retrieval is separate and does not publish
other reviewer annotations or an agreement view.

### Race and lock semantics

The in-memory repository serializes complete transaction callbacks and commits
only a cloned state after success. Therefore submit-versus-close has only two
valid outcomes: a submission that commits first is included in the exact close
snapshot, or a close that commits first makes the later submission fail as
late. Withdrawal and submission share the same OPEN-batch boundary: withdrawal
wins with no accepted row, or submission wins and later withdrawal is rejected
because accepted evidence exists. Failed P3 validation never creates an
accepted row or acceptance audit event.

The PostgreSQL adapter uses the compatible logical lock order
`batch -> assignment -> accepted submission / close snapshot` within a
coarse service-wide advisory transaction lock. It also locks existing
authority rows in deterministic table order before loading the snapshot. This
serializes empty-table insert races as well as row updates. The adapter is
correctness-first and intentionally coarse; deployments must not assume that
non-idempotent transactions can be retried after an unknown commit outcome.

## P4-E persistence additions

Migration `005_submission_close_authority.sql` keeps migrations 001-004
unchanged and adds:

| Record | Stored boundary | Important constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `review_batch_close_submissions` | exact accepted assignment/reviewer/submission-fingerprint set for one close | composite reference to `review_submissions`, unique assignment/reviewer within the batch, immutable after close |
| `review_submission_audit_events` | narrow accepted-submission event metadata | composite reference to the accepted row; no payload, credentials, or claims |
| `rejected_submission_attempts` | bounded rejection metadata only | bounded reason code and no raw rejected request column |
| `review_batches` / `review_assignments` / `review_submissions` | lifecycle guards and immutable identity projections | compatible OPEN-to-CLOSED authority, assigned-to-withdrawn authority, batch lock guards, and existing one-row uniqueness |

The service's `ReviewBatchCloseRecord` stores the same exact accepted P3
submission objects used to create the close result. This is a local persistence
contract for the close authority; it is not a public evidence export.

## Freeze and operational evidence authority (P4-F)

P4-F operationalizes only the authoritative `CLOSED -> FROZEN` transition. It
does not add a protocol lifecycle state, publish a campaign, or turn a frozen
pool into a Human Reference. The operator facade exposes:

```text
freezeBatch
getFrozenPool
buildAgreementEvidence
getAgreementEvidence
createDisclosure
buildPublicEvidenceArtifact
```

All six operations require the existing operator authorization path. Reviewer
authentication and reviewer ownership do not grant access to freeze, retrieve
private frozen evidence, inspect the agreement matrix, create a disclosure, or
build a public artifact.

### Exact CLOSED-set binding and transactional freeze

The freeze request contains only a `batchId`. The service locks the
authoritative batch, requires `CLOSED`, loads the exact persisted P4-E close
record and accepted-submission snapshot, and mechanically verifies the
current authority before calling the existing P3
`freezeCommunityReviewPool(...)` helper:

```text
lock batch
  -> load exact persisted CLOSED manifest, close record, and accepted snapshot
  -> verify batch/protocol/instrument/task/coverage bindings
  -> set-equal assignment IDs, reviewer IDs, and submission fingerprints
  -> call P3 freezeCommunityReviewPool(closeResult)
  -> persist one frozen pool and its freeze fingerprint
  -> transition the batch to FROZEN
  -> write narrow batch_frozen audit metadata
  -> commit
```

The caller cannot choose an accepted set or submit a close object to freeze.
Any mismatch fails closed and rolls back, leaving the batch `CLOSED` with no
new frozen row. P3 validation failure has the same rollback behavior. A
successful retry returns the exact persisted frozen pool and fingerprint; it
does not reconstruct a pool from mutable assignment or submission rows.
The in-memory repository returns clones, while the PostgreSQL boundary uses
the existing one-row/unique constraints, batch authority guard, and new
immutable-record trigger. Once `FROZEN`, assignment, accepted-submission,
close, coverage, and pool replacement/reopen operations are rejected.

Freeze, close, late submission, assignment mutation, duplicate freeze, and
evidence-generation races are serialized by the same batch transaction
boundary. Only coherent ordered outcomes are permitted: a close either
commits before a freeze, or a committed freeze is the sole frozen authority.

### Diagnostic agreement evidence

After a frozen pool exists, `buildAgreementEvidence` calls the existing P3
`buildCommunityReviewAgreementEvidence(...)` helper using the exact stored
frozen pool. The service persists one deterministic artifact per frozen pool
with a separate service persistence fingerprint. It retains human-human
agreement as diagnostic evidence: reviewer statuses, pairwise reports, the
3x3 status confusion matrix, per-requirement and per-case distributions,
disagreement rows, and missing/withdrawn coverage.

The evidence does not collapse disagreements into a majority label. It never
calculates accuracy, correctness, consensus truth, a gold/reference label, a
Judge comparison, calibration, a leaderboard score, or adjudication. A
single-reviewer pool retains the P3 limitation that human-human agreement
cannot be established. Incomplete, pilot, and synthetic fixtures retain their
P3 limitations and are not validated Human Reference evidence.

Agreement retrieval returns the exact persisted artifact, not a recomputation
from current mutable service rows. Repeated generation is idempotent and
deterministic for the same stored frozen pool.

### Private evidence and explicit disclosure policy

Evidence is private by default. `createDisclosure` first requires an
authoritative frozen pool and persisted agreement evidence, then appends an
immutable disclosure decision. The default `PRIVATE` record contains no public
artifact. A `PUBLIC` record requires an explicit disclosure date and policy and
stores the result of P3's
`buildCommunityReviewPublicEvidenceArtifact(...)` allowlist. A public artifact
is generated/exportable evidence only; P4-F does not host, upload, announce,
or expose a public endpoint.

The public boundary excludes reviewer names, email/phone, GitHub or Discord
identity, OAuth/auth subjects, access tokens, cookies, JWTs, IP/device/account
identifiers, qualification answer keys/responses/private material references,
sealed source references, operator notes, and hidden evaluator or Judge
fields. The private persistence row is never used as the public response.
Changing disclosure policy or date appends a new disclosure version and does
not mutate the frozen pool, freeze fingerprint, close result, or prior
disclosure history. No retroactive withdrawal/erasure policy is invented in
P4-F; later account or consent changes do not silently rewrite historical
evidence.

### P4-F persistence and audit boundary

Migration `006_freeze_operational_evidence.sql` keeps the P4-A
`frozen_review_pools` table and adds:

| Record | Stored boundary | Important constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `community_review_agreement_evidence` | exact P3 agreement artifact plus service persistence identity | one row per frozen batch, unique freeze/evidence fingerprints, frozen-pool binding |
| `community_review_disclosures` | append-only PRIVATE/PUBLIC decision, policy version, and optional P3 public artifact | one version per batch, deterministic identity uniqueness, PRIVATE/PUBLIC shape checks, frozen/evidence binding |
| `community_review_evidence_audit_events` | event type, opaque freeze/evidence/disclosure bindings, policy/version, reason code, timestamp | narrow metadata only, foreign-key bindings, immutable rows |

The migration adds insert guards for frozen pools, agreement evidence, and
disclosures, plus immutable triggers for frozen pools and all P4-F evidence
records. P4-G executes these migrations through the PostgreSQL adapter in
Node 24/PostgreSQL 16 CI and keeps the deterministic in-memory adapter for
synthetic tests. The in-memory adapter mirrors freeze idempotency, rollback,
exact-set checks, evidence identity, disclosure append/version semantics,
cloning, and audit metadata.

Evidence audit events are limited to `batch_frozen`, freeze retrieval,
agreement generation/retrieval, disclosure creation, public-artifact
generation, and sanitized rejection metadata. They never copy annotations,
submissions, credentials, auth subjects, answer keys, sealed source material,
or hidden evaluator fields.

## Access, privacy, and audit

Reviewer-facing operations are limited to creating, reading, submitting, and
receiving results/receipts for the authenticated reviewer's own attempt. The
application facade derives the opaque reviewer ID from the P4-B authentication
mapping and ignores caller-supplied owner fields. Operators alone may register,
seal, activate, retire, or inspect pool metadata. Operator authorization is
separate from reviewer identity.

Qualification audit events record only pool registration/state transitions,
attempt issuance, response submission, pass/fail, and receipt issuance with
opaque IDs and sanitized reason codes. They never record raw answer keys,
responses when not required, tokens, cookies, JWTs, claims, private material,
or hidden reasoning. No production retention/deletion policy is invented in
P4-C; retention execution remains later service work.

## Transaction and concurrency model

The in-memory adapter serializes transaction callbacks and commits a cloned
state only after success. A thrown validation or P3/service error rolls back
all mutations. Its maps mirror PostgreSQL uniqueness for pool identity, pool
nonce, attempt, receipt fingerprint, and receipt-per-attempt.

The PostgreSQL implementation uses one real SQL transaction with a fixed
advisory lock and deterministic authority-row locks:

```text
Create attempt:
  BEGIN; lock reviewer/account and active pool; count attempts; insert issued
  attempt with nonce hash; COMMIT.

Submit/evaluate:
  BEGIN; SELECT attempt and pool FOR UPDATE; validate against private material;
  insert the response projection; transition through SUBMITTED to the result;
  COMMIT.

Issue receipt:
  BEGIN; lock qualified attempt; build and P3-validate the receipt; insert the
  unique attempt/fingerprint binding; COMMIT.
```

Submission versus retirement is serialized: either evaluation commits before
retirement or an already-issued attempt is evaluated under the explicitly
permitted retired-pool rule. Two submissions cannot produce two final states;
two receipt issuances cannot produce two rows. The repository rolls back the
SQL transaction on callback or persistence failure and releases the advisory
lock with the connection.

P4-E extends the row-lock design: accepting a submission, withdrawing an
assignment, and closing a batch serialize on the same batch boundary. A
submission is either committed while the batch is `OPEN` and included in the
close snapshot, or rejected after close; no late or replacement submission
overwrites accepted evidence. Existing pure P3 freeze compatibility remains
available to prior tests; P4-F now adds the operator-authorized operational
freeze and evidence authority described above.

## P4-G deployment and readiness boundary

P4-G makes the service deployable and mechanically verifiable without
deploying it. The production path is fail-closed:
`COMMUNITY_REVIEW_ENV=production` requires
`COMMUNITY_REVIEW_STORAGE=postgres`, a PostgreSQL URL, TLS, OIDC JWT
configuration, at least one operator principal, and a private material root.
It cannot select the in-memory repository or synthetic authentication. The
development/test fallbacks are available only when explicitly selected by
typed configuration; they are never a production fallback. PostgreSQL
certificate verification is also mandatory in production.

The PostgreSQL adapter lives in `src/postgres-repository.ts` and implements the
existing `CommunityReviewPersistence` contract. It does not create a second
domain model. Each transaction uses a real `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`, a
service advisory lock for empty-table insert races, deterministic authority
row locks, and the existing transaction validator. JSONB and immutable
records are written through explicit SQL mappings. Migration files remain
append-only.

`src/migrations.ts` is the only migration runner. It loads migrations
`001_...sql` through `006_...sql` in numeric contiguous order, computes a
SHA-256 checksum for every migration, creates
`community_review_schema_migrations`, serializes runners with a PostgreSQL
advisory session lock, applies each missing migration in its own transaction,
and rejects unknown history, gaps, filename changes, checksum drift, missing
historical files, and incomplete application. A rerun of the exact migration
set is idempotent.

The migration runner is intentionally separate from readiness. `migrate` is a
controlled operator command; `/health/ready` only passes after PostgreSQL is
reachable and the exact migration history verifies. It never silently runs a
migration during a health request.

### Runtime and operational checks

The service CLI is built under the isolated service output and supports:

```bash
npm ci --prefix services/community-review-service
npm run community-review:migrate
npm run community-review:readiness
npm run community-review:serve
```

The minimal HTTP runtime intentionally exposes only:

```text
GET /health/live   -> process is serving
GET /health/ready  -> PostgreSQL, migration history, and private root are ready
```

Unknown routes and non-GET methods are rejected. Responses carry a request ID,
no-store/cache and content-type protections, and a bounded request body guard.
Structured JSON logs contain only timestamp, level, event, route, request ID,
status, duration, and bounded readiness reason codes. They never include
authorization headers, JWTs, cookies, subjects, request payloads, database
URLs, stack traces, or private material. SIGINT/SIGTERM stops accepting work,
waits for active requests up to the configured bound, closes idle connections,
and closes the owned PostgreSQL pool.

`services/community-review-service/Dockerfile` builds with Node 24 bookworm slim, keeps the
service dependency tree isolated, creates the private material mount, runs as
the non-root `node` user, and includes a live-probe health check. The image
does not contain private material, credentials, `.env` files, results, or
repository metadata. CI builds it and starts a separate migration command
before checking both live and ready probes.

### Backup, restore, and rollback

The mechanical smoke is `scripts/community-review-backup-restore.mjs`. It is
explicitly opt-in, invokes `pg_dump`/`createdb`/`pg_restore`/`dropdb` without a
shell, restores to a scoped temporary database, checks migration history and a
service table, verifies a non-empty dump, and removes the temporary database
and dump in `finally`. It never prints the connection string. The operational
sequence is documented in `docs/community-review-deployment.md`.

Schema rollback is forward-only: stop intake, preserve the immutable backup,
deploy a tested compatible application, and add a reviewed forward migration
for any schema correction. Do not edit an applied SQL file or manually change
its history checksum. A checksum mismatch or incomplete history is a hard
readiness failure. A transaction with an unknown commit outcome must not be
blindly retried; inspect the authoritative database state and use the
service's idempotent read/retry operation where one exists.

P4-G does not execute an external deployment. Public reviewer intake remains
closed, no real campaign is started, no public evidence endpoint is exposed,
and P5 calibration remains outside this phase.

## Synthetic testing and gates

`qualification.test.ts` uses a fresh synthetic pool and private in-memory key.
It covers pool sealing/immutability, packet blindness by runtime serialization,
complete/duplicate/extra response rejection, server-side pass/fail, nonce and
attempt-limit races, same-attempt submission races, cross-owner and
cross-pool/version/locale/instrument replay, consent/account/pool authority,
retirement ordering, receipt idempotency, caller-created receipt rejection,
audit privacy, and the authenticated application facade. Existing P4-A/P4-B
tests remain green. P4-D service tests additionally cover authenticated
assignment, oldest-eligible-batch selection, exact retry idempotency, private
material fingerprint mismatch rollback, SEALED/CLOSED/FROZEN state gates,
and runtime packet blindness. P4-E service tests additionally cover complete
atomic submission/status validation, exact packet binding, authenticated own
submission retrieval, accepted/replacement/idempotency rules, rejected and
accepted audit privacy, CLOSED/FROZEN late rejection, exact close snapshots,
close rollback/idempotency, simultaneous submissions and closes,
submit-versus-close races, withdrawal-versus-submission races, and operator
authorization. P4-F tests additionally cover exact close-set verification,
operator-only freeze/evidence/disclosure paths, immutable frozen-pool retries,
rollback on P3 freeze failure, persisted-pool-only agreement evidence,
confusion/distribution/disagreement preservation, single-reviewer limitations,
private/public disclosure versioning, runtime privacy firewall checks, and
freeze/close/evidence races. All fixtures are synthetic and unmistakably
non-evidence.

Run the isolated harness with:

```bash
npm run typecheck:community-review-service
npm run test:community-review-service
npm run test:community-review-service:postgres
```

The repository-level gates remain applicable to the complete change:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run benchmark
npm run test:governance
npm run test:package
npm run test:website
git diff --check
```

The root benchmark remains provider-free. Its expected unavailable-provider
behavior is unchanged; P4-C does not add model calls or turn unavailable Judge
errors into an official score.

## Explicit exclusions and phase handoff

P4-E and P4-F implement service semantics only. They do not implement or claim:

- an external PostgreSQL/identity-provider deployment, public hosting, or
  managed secret-store provisioning;
- public reviewer signup/intake, payments, abuse controls, a reviewer
  dashboard, campaign scheduling, or a real Community Review campaign;
- a real Community Review campaign, public reviewer intake, or public hosting
  of evidence;
- majority voting, agreement-as-correctness, gold/reference labels,
  adjudication, Judge comparison, calibration, accuracy claims, or leaderboard
  scoring (P5), including any conversion of P4-F agreement into correctness;
- a Review Workspace integration, root-package export, or production
  deployment; or
- any reopening transition after `CLOSED`.

P4-G is complete at the deployable/readiness boundary. It does not deploy an
identity provider, secret store, or service externally; open reviewer intake,
run a real campaign, publish evidence, or implement a retention/erasure
operation. P4 Community Review Service is **PASS — DEPLOYMENT-READY** at this
boundary. Public reviewer intake remains **NOT OPEN** and the real campaign is
**NOT STARTED**. P5 Community calibration is **NOT STARTED**. The frozen pool
is not a Human Reference, and future work must preserve the private material
boundary and the distinction between P3 validity and P4 authority.

## L2-C2C handoff status

The L2-C2C implementation is complete in the task branch when its delivery
commit is merged, but repository delivery and private staging are separate
status lines. The deployed application setting must remain `CLOSED`, the
historical reviewer/campaign intake flag must remain `false`, and no public
application form or CORS origin is authorized. L2-C2C is not overall PASS until
the exact merged main SHA has passed the private staging live/ready, closed
write-rejection, isolated synthetic localhost-only `OPEN` dry run, backup, and
privacy checks described in `docs/community-review-staging-gate.md`.
