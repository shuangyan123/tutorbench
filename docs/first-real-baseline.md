# First real bilingual Tutor baseline

The current canonical dataset is `tutor-eval-v0.2a@0.2a.6`: 24 English cases
plus 24 `zh-CN` cases. Real-model collection is preliminary and uncalibrated;
it does not change the dataset, generation profile, evaluator, Judge rubrics,
scoring, response identity, or public website. Codex and CI do not make
provider calls unless an operator explicitly runs one of the live collection
commands below.

Historical artifact examples later in this document retain their recorded
dataset/model identities and must not be rewritten as current evidence.

The three provider boundaries remain separate:

```text
Tutor provider -> canonical model host -> TutorResponseCorpus
TutorResponseCorpus -> evaluator / Judge provider -> evaluation artifact
evaluation artifact -> optional local Review Translation sidecar -> private Audit
```

## Zero-paid-API local baseline runner

For a genuine model served locally through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, use
the repository-owned three-stage runner. It only accepts a loopback canonical
host endpoint, requires an explicit model identity and baseline ID, never
invokes a Judge, and never publishes artifacts.

Configure the upstream local model bridge in one terminal:

```powershell
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_AUTH_MODE = "none"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL = "<exact local model id>"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_API_PATH = "/chat/completions"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_FIELD = "max_tokens"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REASONING_SPLIT = "disabled"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REQUIRE_REASONING_SEPARATION = "false"
node examples/canonical-model-host/chat-completions-server.mjs
```

In a second terminal bind the baseline identity:

```powershell
$env:TUTORBENCH_LOCAL_MODEL = $env:TUTOR_MODEL
$env:TUTORBENCH_LOCAL_PROVIDER = "local"
$env:TUTORBENCH_BASELINE_ID = "preliminary-local-<model>-001"
# Optional trustworthy snapshot/version:
# $env:TUTORBENCH_LOCAL_MODEL_VERSION = "<snapshot>"
```

Then execute the stages deliberately:

```powershell
npm run baseline:local:plan
npm run baseline:local:smoke
# Inspect the four recorded responses and report before continuing.
npm run baseline:local:full
```

`baseline:local:plan` is a zero-call dry run over the fixed bilingual smoke
cohort. `baseline:local:smoke` records exactly four responses (two English,
two `zh-CN`), validates the partial corpus, and writes an offline evaluation
without a Judge. `baseline:local:full` requires that exact smoke corpus,
resumes it in place, collects only the missing cases, requires 48/48 full
coverage, and rewrites the offline evaluation for the full frozen corpus.

The runner writes only under ignored `artifacts/real-model/` paths. A genuine
local model run is real-model evidence, but remains
`preliminary / uncalibrated / publicLeaderboardEligible=false`. A synthetic
or fake local server remains a fixture and must not be represented as a real
baseline.

## Configure the Tutor host

Build with the repository-supported Node 24 runtime first:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build
```

The provider-neutral bridge reads credentials only from the local process
environment. It sends one non-streaming Chat Completions request per
`/generate` call, makes no provider retry, and returns only final visible
`message.content` plus sanitized latency/token metrics. Reasoning content,
tool traces, provider payloads, request IDs, and error bodies never enter the
benchmark envelope.

DeepSeek example:

```powershell
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_BASE_URL = "https://api.deepseek.com"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL = "<exact model id>"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_API_PATH = "/chat/completions"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_FIELD = "max_tokens"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REASONING_SPLIT = "disabled"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REQUIRE_REASONING_SEPARATION = "false"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
node examples/canonical-model-host/chat-completions-server.mjs
```

MiniMax-compatible example:

```powershell
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_BASE_URL = "https://api.minimax.io/v1"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL = "<exact model id>"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_API_PATH = "/chat/completions"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_FIELD = "max_completion_tokens"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REASONING_SPLIT = "enabled"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_REQUIRE_REASONING_SEPARATION = "true"
$env:TUTOR_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
node examples/canonical-model-host/chat-completions-server.mjs
```

For MiniMax reasoning models, `reasoning_split=true` is a safety boundary:
the bridge records only final `message.content`, while provider thinking stays
outside `TutorResponseCorpus`. `TUTOR_MODEL_REQUIRE_REASONING_SEPARATION=true`
fails closed if a provider still puts a `<think>...</think>` wrapper in
`message.content`; it never tries to extract a guessed final answer. DeepSeek
already returns `reasoning_content` separately, so its host configuration keeps
the optional MiniMax field disabled and still reads only `message.content`.

Use the provider's current API documentation to confirm the endpoint and
output-token field before a paid run: [DeepSeek Chat Completions](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion/)
and [MiniMax OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/api-reference/text-chat-openai).
The collector's `--provider` value and `--model` value are provenance, not
credentials. Never put a key in source, `.env`, command output, corpus,
report, evaluation result, or logs.

## Dry-run and four-case bilingual smoke

In a second terminal, use the same exact model identity. The dry-run validates
the canonical packet and makes zero host calls:

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js collect-model `
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9001/generate `
  --provider minimax `
  --model $env:TUTOR_MODEL `
  --locale zh-CN `
  --limit 2 `
  --dry-run
```

For one corpus containing two English and two Chinese cases, select four
explicit IDs. This keeps the smoke artifact bilingual while still exercising
the case-authoritative locale on every packet:

```powershell
$smokeCorpus = "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-$($env:TUTOR_MODEL)-tutor-bilingual-001.corpus.json"
$smokeReport = "$smokeCorpus.report.json"

node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js collect-model `
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9001/generate `
  --provider minimax `
  --model $env:TUTOR_MODEL `
  --case fraction-misconception-001 `
  --case hint-only-linear-equation-001 `
  --case fraction-misconception-001-zh-CN `
  --case hint-only-linear-equation-001-zh-CN `
  --corpus-id preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001 `
  --output $smokeCorpus `
  --report $smokeReport

node dist/src/cli/tutor-corpus-validate.js --corpus $smokeCorpus
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus $smokeCorpus `
  --report-locale zh-CN `
  --output artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json
```

The smoke corpus should have four successful `recorded_model` responses,
`coverage: "partial"`, the current `baseline-native-default` generation
identity, no failures, and no hidden/provider fields. The initial evaluation
does not call a Judge; Judge-required rubrics remain explicit errors. Inspect
the response text and metadata before spending quota on all 48 cases.

## Resume and complete the 48-case corpus

A new collection refuses to overwrite an existing corpus path. If a run is
interrupted or has failed/missing case-runs, resume the same path explicitly:

Resume reuses only successful responses whose dataset, case version, model,
model version, prompt identity, generation spec, corpus identity, and run
index still match. Missing or previously failed case-runs are attempted once
in the new invocation. A mismatch fails closed before any host call. After the
smoke is reviewed, continue the *same* corpus path without any `--case` or
`--limit` selection flags:

```powershell
$fullCorpus = $smokeCorpus
$fullReport = $smokeReport

node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js collect-model `
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9001/generate `
  --provider minimax `
  --model $env:TUTOR_MODEL `
  --resume $smokeCorpus `
  --output $fullCorpus `
  --report $fullReport

node dist/src/cli/tutor-corpus-validate.js --corpus $fullCorpus --full
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus $fullCorpus `
  --full `
  --report-locale en `
  --output artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json
```

For a successful four-case smoke this prints `Reused responses: 4`,
`Model calls made: 44`, and `Responses: 48/48`. The four smoke responses and
the forty-four newly completed responses remain under one corpus ID and one
response-identity scheme; this command does not create a second full corpus.
Full coverage means 48 planned calls, 48 successful responses, zero
collection failures, and `coverage: "full"`. Evaluation replays the frozen
corpus through `RecordedTutor`; it never regenerates Tutor text.
Because this historical corpus records `tutor-eval-v0.2a@0.2a.3`, the evaluate
command resolves and validates it against the immutable `0.2a.3` snapshot. The
`--allow-compatible-replay` flag is only for an explicitly audited later target
identity, not for this same-identity historical evaluation.

## Optional preliminary Judge

The generic Judge path is selected separately and is configured only through
environment variables. DeepSeek and MiniMax-compatible endpoints can use the
same path; provider-specific controls are not inferred from the provider
name. JSON mode may be disabled for a compatible endpoint, but the existing
runtime parser and rubric-ownership checks remain mandatory.

```powershell
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_PROVIDER = "minimax"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MODEL = "<exact judge model id>"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_BASE_URL = "https://api.minimax.io/v1"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_API_PATH = "/chat/completions"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_FIELD = "max_completion_tokens"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS = "2048"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_REASONING_SPLIT = "enabled"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_JSON_MODE = "disabled"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS = "2"

node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus $fullCorpus `
  --full `
  --judge-chat-completions `
  --report-locale zh-CN `
  --output artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json
```

The MiniMax OpenAI-compatible documentation currently lists
`max_completion_tokens` maximums of 524288 for MiniMax-M3 and 204800 for the
listed M2.x models. The example uses `2048` as a conservative cross-model
Judge cap; it is not a new generic Judge limit. Confirm the exact model's
current limit before increasing it. With reasoning models, the enabled
`CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_REASONING_SPLIT` setting keeps thinking out of the
JSON parser: the Judge parses only final `message.content` and never stores
`reasoning_content`, `reasoning_details`, or provider metadata.

The Tutor provider, Judge provider, and optional Review Translation provider
are recorded as separate descriptors. The result remains preliminary and
uncalibrated; it is not a leaderboard or model ranking.

## Observed DeepSeek V4-Pro Judge run and strict recovery

The first full bilingual Judge run used the frozen 48-response corpus,
`deepseek-v4-pro`, the repository's
`tutor-eval-pedagogy-judge-system@0.3` prompt, thinking enabled, high reasoning
effort, and an 8192-token output cap:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MODEL = "deepseek-v4-pro"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_THINKING = "enabled"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT = "high"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS = "8192"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS = "2"

$judgeEvaluation = "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-m27-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json"
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus $fullCorpus `
  --full `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --report-locale zh-CN `
  --output $judgeEvaluation
```

That observed run completed with 21 passed, 24 failed, and 3
`judge_timeout` errors. The timeout case-runs were
`language-word-context-001-zh-CN`, `programming-loop-diagnosis-001`, and
`programming-loop-diagnosis-001-zh-CN`. They were recovered with a
conservative 180-second timeout for this real V4-Pro baseline after observed
latencies above 60 seconds; this is not a claim that DeepSeek always needs 180
seconds:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = "180000"
$recoveredEvaluation = "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-m27-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation-recovered.json"
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus $fullCorpus `
  --full `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --resume-evaluation $judgeEvaluation `
  --report-locale zh-CN `
  --output $recoveredEvaluation
```

`--resume-evaluation` validates the previous artifact and its corpus, dataset,
Tutor, case, frozen-response, evaluator, and Judge semantic identities before
any Judge call. Valid `passed` and `failed` case-runs are reused; `error`
case-runs are evaluated again through `RecordedTutor`, without regenerating
Tutor responses. The expected recovery telemetry is 45 reused evaluation
case-runs, 3 Judge calls, and 48 final case-runs. This is operator-controlled
recovery, not an automatic retry policy, and changing timeout or max-attempt
execution policy does not change the Judge scoring identity.

This remains a preliminary, uncalibrated result and is not eligible for a
public leaderboard or model-ranking claim.

## Private Review Translation and Audit

Review Translation is an after-evaluation reading aid. It is not part of
Tutor generation, Judge input, scoring, corpus identity, replay, or public
artifacts. Keep the original English/Chinese audit evidence and use only the
private website output:

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js review-translate `
  --evaluation artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json `
  --target-locale zh-CN `
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9000/translate `
  --provider local-review-translator `
  --model <review-translator-model> `
  --output artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.review.zh-CN.json

node dist/src/cli/website-build.js `
  --evaluation artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json `
  --review-translation artifacts/real-model/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001.review.zh-CN.json `
  --locale zh-CN `
  --output website/private-dist/preliminary-minimax-tutor-bilingual-001
```

The sidecar is source-hash-bound and local-only. Missing or failed
translations do not change evaluation results; the Audit keeps raw source
text available for human review.

All files under `artifacts/` and `website/private-dist/` are ignored. Do not
commit real provider responses, reports, credentials, raw payloads, hidden
reasoning, tool traces, or private user data.
