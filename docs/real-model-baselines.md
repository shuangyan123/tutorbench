# Real-model baseline collection

Tutor Benchmark has two deliberately separate frozen-evidence paths. Both
produce the same `TutorResponseCorpus`, can be replayed and evaluated offline,
and remain preliminary until independently reviewed and calibrated.

| Path | Transport body | Evidence meaning | Corpus generation identity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Tutor | `TutorTurnInput` | A product or external Tutor response | absent |
| Canonical model | `TutorExecutionPacketFile` with one case | A response from the exact canonical request and generation spec sent to a model host | `baseline-native-default` |

## Product Tutor evidence

`tutorbench collect` is the Product / External Tutor path. It sends the
provider-independent Tutor HTTP v1 request:

```text
POST /respond
body: TutorTurnInput
```

The body contains Tutor-visible case context such as `currentStudentMessage`,
`studentState`, conversation, and the learning objective. It does not contain
evaluator-only annotations. The external product may use persona, memory,
tools, hidden product prompts, or product-specific model routing; those are
part of what is being evaluated.

The Product Tutor descriptor must identify the actual configuration:

```bash
tutorbench collect \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:8000/respond \
  --provider my-product \
  --model tutor-product \
  --model-version product-release-2026-08 \
  --prompt-id product-tutor-config \
  --prompt-version product-config-v3 \
  --provenance external \
  --output artifacts/product/product.json \
  --report artifacts/product/product.report.json
```

`--prompt-version` is a stable Product Tutor/orchestration configuration
identity. It is not the benchmark baseline prompt. Product collection writes
no `generationSpec`, and its ordinary provenance is `external` or
`review_workspace`. `synthetic` remains available for local fixtures. Passing
`--provenance recorded_model` fails with:

```text
recorded_model requires canonical model collection
```

## Canonical model evidence

`tutorbench collect-model` is the only path that can write
`recorded_model` provenance and `baseline-native-default` generation identity:

```bash
tutorbench collect-model \
  --http http://127.0.0.1:9000/generate \
  --provider example-provider \
  --model example-model \
  --model-version example-snapshot \
  --locale zh-CN \
  --limit 3 \
  --runs 1 \
  --output artifacts/real-model/model.json \
  --report artifacts/real-model/model.report.json
```

Omit `--locale` for the complete current bilingual dataset. `--locale en` or
`--locale zh-CN` filters case selection only; the case's own locale remains
the authoritative generation target. Use repeated `--case` flags when one
smoke corpus must contain both languages.

For each case/run, the collector calls the existing
`buildTutorExecutionPacketFile()` and sends one validated packet directly to
the host. The request has this shape and no Product Tutor fields:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "datasetId": "tutor-eval-v0.2a",
  "datasetVersion": "...",
  "generationSpec": {
    "specId": "tutor-baseline-generation",
    "specVersion": "0.4a.3",
    "prompt": { "id": "tutor-baseline-system", "version": "0.2", "sha256": "..." },
    "maxOutputTokens": 1024
  },
  "cases": [{ "caseId": "...", "caseVersion": "...", "messages": [] }]
}
```

The packet builder is the source of truth for the canonical system prompt,
prompt SHA, visible context, conversation messages, and message order. The
collector also records each case's resolved `locale` and includes a stable
`targetLocale=...` line in the visible generation context. The collector does
not prepend a prompt, inject memory/persona, rewrite or
truncate messages, or add a second hidden-data sanitizer. The packet firewall
excludes evaluator-only annotations, ground truth, misconceptions, rubrics,
critical failures, Judge prompts, reference answers, human annotations, and
disclosure-policy fields.

The canonical host returns a small provider-neutral envelope:

```json
{
  "output": { "text": "...", "metrics": {} },
  "executionSupport": { "maxOutputTokens": true }
}
```

The response is runtime-validated. `executionSupport` must be present and
declare the required `maxOutputTokens` control. Any optional control specified
by a future generation spec (`temperature`, `reasoningEffort`, or `seed`) must
also be attested as supported. The collector reuses
`assertTutorGenerationSpecExecutionSupport()` and fails closed before recording
a response when a required control is unsupported or the attestation is
missing/invalid.

The canonical Tutor descriptor derives `promptId` and `promptVersion` from the
generation spec. `recorded_model` is fixed by `collect-model`; there is no
`--provenance` or `--prompt-version` flag on that command.

## What the protocol proves

The HTTP protocol proves what the benchmark serialized and sent: the exact
validated packet, messages, generation spec, and the host's explicit support
attestation. It cannot cryptographically prove that a remote server did not
silently modify the request internally after receipt. Reviewed canonical
evidence therefore still requires a trusted host implementation, provider-
direct integration, or a publication attestation. The evidence levels are:

```text
Product evidence
  Product-defined orchestration received TutorTurnInput.

Canonical-request evidence
  The benchmark sent the exact TutorExecutionPacket and generation spec.

Reviewed canonical evidence
  The host implementation and provider forwarding were independently reviewed.
```

The local `examples/canonical-model-host/server.py` server is a synthetic
protocol fixture only. It contains no provider SDK or credentials and must not
be used to claim a real baseline. The same directory also contains an
OpenAI-specific `openai-server.mjs` and a provider-neutral
`chat-completions-server.mjs`. The latter reads
`TUTOR_MODEL_API_KEY`, `TUTOR_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `TUTOR_MODEL`, and explicit
path/output-token-field settings from the local environment; it makes one
request per packet, performs no provider retry, and returns only final visible
content. Set `TUTOR_MODEL_REASONING_SPLIT=enabled` for a MiniMax reasoning
model so the host sends `reasoning_split: true`; pair it with
`TUTOR_MODEL_REQUIRE_REASONING_SEPARATION=true` to reject an unsplit
`<think>...</think>` wrapper rather than guessing which text is final. For
DeepSeek, leave the optional split setting disabled: its separate
`reasoning_content` field is ignored and only `message.content` is returned.
Both hosts are local integration code, not Benchmark Core or package
runtime dependencies, and neither is invoked by CI. See [the first real
baseline procedure](first-real-baseline.md) for DeepSeek/MiniMax setup,
bilingual smoke, full collection, resume, validation, Judge, and private
Review Translation order.

## Failure, retry, and coverage semantics

Collection is sequential and performs no automatic retry within one invocation.
A network failure,
timeout, non-2xx response, invalid JSON, invalid output, invalid support
attestation, or unsupported generation control is an execution failure, not a
Tutor response containing an error string. Successful responses are retained
on partial failure; failure reports contain only case/version/run identity and
a stable failure code. A new run refuses to overwrite an existing corpus.
`--resume <path>` explicitly loads an existing corpus, validates dataset/case
versions, model and prompt identity, generation spec, corpus/run identity, and
reuses only successful case-runs. Missing or failed runs are retried in the
new invocation; a mismatch fails closed before any host call.

Coverage is `full` only when all selected executions succeed and the selection
covers the complete dataset. A subset or any failed execution is `partial`.
Both corpus modes validate, replay through `RecordedTutor`, and evaluate with
the existing `tutorbench evaluate` path. The evaluator and scoring contracts do
not infer evidence mode from provenance.

`responseId` continues to use `deriveTutorResponseId()` as the identity source
of truth. Product responses omit generation identity; canonical responses
include the complete generation spec identity. Existing generation-bound and
legacy corpora remain readable.

## Judge a frozen corpus with DeepSeek

Judge execution is a separate, explicit evaluation step. It does not call the
Tutor or Nemotron host again. The DeepSeek integration uses the provider's
OpenAI-compatible `POST /chat/completions` transport and is not the OpenAI
Responses provider; its result descriptor is `provider: "deepseek"` with the
exact configured model ID. Chat Completions JSON mode is object-only, not an
equivalent claim of strict Structured Outputs. The existing Judge parser and
rubric-ownership validation remain the final trust boundary.

Use Node 24 in the authoritative CI environment. A local Node 26 development
shell may run the commands if the repository currently works, but it is
outside the declared `>=24 <25` engine range. Configure credentials only in
the local process environment:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MODEL = "<exact provider-accepted model id>"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
$env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS = "2"
# Optional generation controls:
# $env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_THINKING = "enabled" # enabled (default) or disabled
# $env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT = "high" # high (default) or max
# $env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS = "8192" # positive integer; 8192 (default)
# Temperature is allowed only when thinking is disabled:
# $env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_THINKING = "disabled"
# $env:DEEPSEEK_JUDGE_TEMPERATURE = "0"
```

The DeepSeek V4 Judge profile is explicit and repository-owned: thinking is
`enabled`, reasoning effort is `high`, the maximum output is `8192` tokens,
JSON mode is `json_object`, streaming is disabled, the execution timeout is
`60000` milliseconds, and the transport attempt limit is `2`. The timeout and
attempt values are environment overrides, with positive-integer timeout
validation and the existing `1..3` attempt validation. These effective values
are recorded in Judge provenance as `timeoutMs` and `maxAttempts`, separately
from each call's observed `judgeMetrics.latencyMs` and `attempts`.

Timeouts remain `judge_timeout` errors with a null score and no timeout retry.
Transient HTTP retry behavior is unchanged. Thinking-enabled runs reject
temperature; thinking-disabled runs omit reasoning effort unless it was
explicitly configured. Provider `reasoning_content` is private execution data
and is not benchmark evidence: it is not persisted, logged, placed in
diagnostics or metrics, or copied into artifacts. DeepSeek JSON mode requests
an object but is not OpenAI strict JSON Schema Structured Outputs. A provider
`finish_reason` of `length` is reported as `judge_output_truncated`, remains a
case `ERROR` with a null score, and retains only sanitized latency, attempts,
and token usage; the partial content is not Judge evidence.

The 60000ms default is evidence-based, not a completion guarantee. In a
previous 23-case run, 2 cases timed out at about 30 seconds; replaying those
same two frozen responses with a 60000ms timeout produced 0 errors, 2 failures,
and 34084ms observed Judge latency. In a later 23-case run, the only error was
`programming-test-failure-001`, whose `outputTokens` was exactly `4096` with a
`judge_result_invalid` diagnostic. A diagnostic rerun at 8192 produced 0
errors, and a subsequent rerun restored to 4096 also produced 0 errors. The
evidence indicates stochastic long-tail output/truncation risk; it does not
show that this case deterministically requires more than 4096 tokens. The
evaluator version was recorded as `0.3a.2`; the profile and diagnostics change
execution observability without changing successful Judge scoring semantics.
New semantic runs use the separately versioned evaluator described in the
disclosure/diagnosis audit.

After building, run a one-case Judge smoke over the existing ignored corpus:

```powershell
npm run build
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --case "hint-only-linear-equation-001" `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/nemotron-deepseek-judge-smoke-001.json"
```

Then run the first three available cases:

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --limit 3 `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/nemotron-deepseek-judge-smoke-003.json"
```

Finally, omit both selection flags for the complete available corpus:

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --judge-deepseek `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.deepseek-judged.json"
```

`--case` values are resolved against the dataset and the current corpus before
`--limit` truncates stable case-ID order. The output keeps the original corpus
ID/version and source `coverage`, available-response count, and missing-case
count; `evaluationSelection` records the actual subset and selected response
count. A partial 23/24 corpus remains partial even when one selected case is
evaluated. Missing credentials produce `judge_unavailable` without a network
request; timeouts and transient 429/5xx transport failures use bounded retries;
malformed or ownership-invalid Judge output fails closed. DeepSeek Judge
evidence is preliminary LLM-as-Judge evidence, not human calibration or a
learning-outcome measurement, and it does not make this corpus leaderboard
eligible.

The historical 23-response corpus records dataset `0.2a` and
`language-verb-check-001@1.0.0`. To evaluate it under the post-PR #26 target
semantics, use the explicit audited bridge:

```powershell
node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus "artifacts/real-model/preliminary-openrouter-nemotron-baseline-001.json" `
  --allow-compatible-replay `
  --limit 3 `
  --output "artifacts/real-model/nemotron-semantic-replay-003.json"
```

The bridge is documented in
[`frozen-corpus-semantic-replay.md`](frozen-corpus-semantic-replay.md). It
preserves source corpus identity and response IDs, evaluates the historical
target `0.2a.1`/`0.3a.3` semantics, and records both identities in
`semanticReplay`.
Without the flag, the same source/target mismatch remains fail-closed.

## Generic Chat Completions Judge and report locale

For a provider other than the existing OpenAI or DeepSeek adapters, use
`--judge-chat-completions` and configure the provider-neutral environment:

```powershell
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_PROVIDER = "minimax"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MODEL = "<exact judge model id>"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_BASE_URL = "https://api.minimax.io/v1"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_API_PATH = "/chat/completions"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_API_KEY = "<local secret>"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_FIELD = "max_completion_tokens"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS = "2048"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_REASONING_SPLIT = "enabled"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_JSON_MODE = "disabled"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = "60000"
$env:CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_MAX_ATTEMPTS = "2"

node dist/src/cli/tutorbench.js evaluate `
  --corpus artifacts/real-model/preliminary-provider-model-tutor-bilingual-001.corpus.json `
  --full `
  --judge-chat-completions `
  --report-locale zh-CN `
  --output artifacts/real-model/preliminary-provider-model-tutor-bilingual-001.evaluation.json
```

The generic path accepts `max_tokens` or `max_completion_tokens` explicitly,
can omit Chat Completions JSON mode when the provider does not support it, and
still parses only final `message.content` through the existing strict TutorEval
Judge contract. `CHAT_COMPLETIONS_JUDGE_REASONING_SPLIT=enabled` adds the
provider-compatible `reasoning_split: true` request field; disabled or absent
configuration omits it. It never stores `reasoning_content`,
`reasoning_details`, or provider error bodies. Missing credentials produce
`judge_unavailable` without a network call; timeout, malformed, HTTP, and
ownership failures remain errors with null scores.

The current MiniMax OpenAI-compatible documentation lists a maximum
`max_completion_tokens` value of 524288 for MiniMax-M3 and 204800 for the
listed M2.x models. The example's `2048` is a conservative cross-model Judge
cap, not a generic Chat Completions limit; verify the exact configured model's
current limit before increasing it.

`--report-locale en` is the default. `--report-locale zh-CN` changes report
labels only; it does not select cases, change `targetLocale`, translate
responses, change scoring, or alter corpus/evaluation identity. The
language-context breakdown always groups by each case's authoritative locale.

## Dry-run and publication boundary

Both commands support `--dry-run`. Product dry-run reports `generation spec =
none`; canonical dry-run prepares the canonical cases/messages and reports
`0` host calls. Neither dry-run reads provider credentials or makes network
requests.

Artifacts are written under ignored local paths by default, remain
`preliminary`, `uncalibrated`, and `publicLeaderboardEligible: false`, and are
never copied into website public data automatically. This repository does not
call a commercial model during normal builds, tests, CI, website generation,
or package smoke; the optional local host requires an intentional credentialed
run. It does not publish a leaderboard or claim that a synthetic fixture is
real-model evidence.
