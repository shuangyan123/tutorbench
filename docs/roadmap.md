# Roadmap

## 0.1 Benchmark Foundation and TutorEval — COMPLETE

- Typed provider-independent contracts
- Runtime validation for synthetic scenarios and rubrics
- Deterministic evaluators and direct-answer leakage proxy
- Scripted synthetic adapter
- Failure-isolating benchmark runner
- Console and JSON reporting
- TutorEval case/hidden-annotation separation
- Disclosure-aware answer-leakage proxy
- Atomic teaching rubrics and centralized category aggregation
- Critical-failure quality gates and complete versioned run records
- Repeated case runs and reserved counterfactual pair identity
- Contract tests, Node 22 CI, and repository rules

## 0.2 Rubric & Dataset Design — PARTIAL: 0.2A dataset + 0.2B calibration infrastructure + critical-failure extension

- [x] Versioned pedagogical taxonomy and structured scenario difficulty
- [x] Curated 24-case English synthetic dataset across five subjects
- [x] Authored 24-case `zh-CN` cohort with locale-aware coverage and reporting
- [x] Atomic rubric authoring metadata and double-counting rules
- [x] Disclosure-policy coverage and counterfactual adaptation pairs
- [x] Dataset integrity validation and deterministic coverage report
- [x] Calibration contracts, blind packet export, agreement metrics, and adjudication boundary
- [x] Separate human critical-failure calibration contract, target registry, agreement, adjudication, and synthetic pipeline fixtures
- [x] Canonical cross-category human rubric pilot package and strict reviewer import boundary (reviewer-ready; no real reviewer data)
- [ ] Independent human rubric review using real reviewers
- [ ] Independent human critical-failure review using real reviewers
- [ ] Adjudication and human reference generation using real reviewer data

## Case System vNext — DESIGN SPECIFICATION

- [x] Define multi-axis authoring model: discipline profile, D1-D5 content depth, P1-P5 pedagogical difficulty, and H1-H3 interaction horizon
- [x] Define prerequisite-bounded human-optimal instance and general reasoning concepts
- [x] Replace the provisional five-discipline matrix with the audit-seeded 23-domain taxonomy and explicit gap coverage
- [x] Migrate the 15-archetype pilot to seven audit-seeded domains with explicit subdomain/practice metadata
- [x] Preserve frozen `tutor-eval-v0.2a` semantics and current Tutor Health behavior
- [x] Implement a versioned vNext pilot-archetype schema after methodology review
- [x] Author the first 15 D1/D3/D5 pilot archetypes; independent methodology/content review remains pending
- [x] Add provider-neutral evaluator stress harness for efficiency, opacity, generalization, prerequisite compatibility, and equivalent-strategy ties
- [x] Add precise Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Python-debugging strategy profiles with domain-specific stress fixtures
- [x] Add explicit learning-oriented vs exam-oriented teaching objective profiles and counterfactual stress fixtures
- [ ] Run repeated live-Judge stress tests and independently review fixture expectations
- [ ] Decide whether Reasoning & Transfer becomes a Tutor Health dimension or remains a separate profile/reporting area

See [Case System vNext](case-system-vnext.md), the
[Core Coverage Matrix](case-system-vnext-coverage-matrix.md), and the
[Evaluator Stress Test](case-system-vnext-evaluator-stress.md).

## 0.3 LLM-as-Judge Calibration — PARTIAL: 0.3A hybrid + 0.3B OpenAI provider

- [x] Versioned v0.1 judge system prompt retained for compatibility
- [x] Versioned v0.2 Judge prompt contract
- [x] Provider-independent judge input/output contracts
- [x] Pure pedagogy score and quality-gate calculations
- [x] Runtime validation for judge input and result JSON
- [x] Rubric-owned deterministic/Judge routing
- [x] Provider-independent Judge execution boundary
- [x] Deterministic and Judge result merge with partial-evidence preservation
- [x] Opt-in OpenAI Responses API Judge provider with Structured Outputs
- [x] Bounded transport retry, timeout, refusal, and invalid-result handling
- [x] Dry-run/live CLI selection with no live calls in CI
- [ ] Pairwise evaluation
- [ ] Judge-vs-human calibration using a real 0.2B reference set

See [the 0.3A hybrid orchestration guide](tutor-eval-v0.3a.md) and [the 0.3B
provider guide](tutor-eval-v0.3b.md). The phase remains partial: the provider
is single-provider and opt-in, Judge results are not human-calibrated, and no
pairwise or statistical evaluation claim is included.

## 0.4 Tutor Integration Layer — PARTIAL: public runner + portable reproducibility + HTTP adapter

- [x] Stable versioned Tutor response corpus contract
- [x] Canonical TutorGenerationSpec with prompt SHA-256 identity and output limit
- [x] Canonical TutorExecutionPacket with deterministic messages and hidden-data firewall
- [x] Portable baseline-native-default generation profile without unsupported shared controls
- [x] Dry host executor for packet-to-corpus proof
- [x] Recorded/replay Tutor adapter
- [x] Tutor-visible case packet export and hidden-data firewall
- [x] Existing 0.2B calibration conversion
- [x] Direct generic Tutor runner and stable package-root public API
- [x] Provider-neutral external Tutor protocol documented and implemented as HTTP v1
- [x] Generic external HTTP adapter, `tutorbench run` CLI, and cross-language example
- [x] Product Tutor response collection with explicit product provenance and absent generation identity
- [x] Canonical model evidence execution boundary with exact packet transport and support attestation
- [ ] Optional Review Workspace integration
- [ ] Actual reviewed real-model baseline artifacts
- [ ] Broader model adapters if required

See [the 0.4A.3 locale and audit guide](tutor-eval-v0.4a.3-locale.md), the
[historical 0.4A.2 generation and response corpus guide](tutor-eval-v0.4a.md),
and [the real-model evidence guide](real-model-baselines.md). The repository
remains independent from Review Workspace. Product collection and canonical
model collection consume separate provider-neutral boundaries; neither path
creates public model results automatically.
See [the product-boundary note](benchmark-product-boundary.md) for the
dependency map and public API classification.

## Public Delivery — PARTIAL

This is a separate package and website productization track. It consumes the
provider-independent benchmark through stable package and static, secret-free
artifact boundaries and does not change the methodology phases above.

- [x] Stable package-root API and `tutorbench` CLI
- [x] Generic external HTTP Tutor adapter and cross-language example
- [x] Package tarball allow-list and local consumer smoke without OpenAI
- [x] Release validation workflow with tag/version checking and artifacts
- [x] Static website build and GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- [x] Project-site base path support and generated artifact firewall
- [x] Read-only static website shell and Developer Preview status
- [x] Public TutorEval case serializer with evaluator-only field exclusion
- [x] Coverage-backed case explorer and responsive route layout
- [x] Empty leaderboard, model, heatmap, and trial contracts without fake runs
- [x] Local adapter/corpus run guide and methodology limitations
- [x] Provider-free five-minute Quickstart with a fixed deterministic smoke subset
- [ ] Public result artifact pipeline for reproducible model runs
- [ ] Public submission/review workflow (separate phase)
- [x] First intentional npm package publication
- [ ] Reproducible real-model response collection

## Community Review track

This track is intentionally separate from the historical Human Reference
calibration artifacts and from the later real-review and statistical phases.

### P3 Community Review Protocol — COMPLETE

- [x] Provider-independent `community-review-protocol@0.1.0` contracts
- [x] Strict qualification receipt, instrument, locale, packet, submission,
      close, freeze, and public-artifact validators
- [x] Deterministic SHA-256 identity for protocol, guide, localization,
      qualification, task set, batch, assignment, packet, submission, close,
      pool, and public evidence
- [x] Positive-allowlist blindness firewall and exact atomic coverage
- [x] Late/replacement rejection, explicit incomplete/pilot marking, and
      disagreement-preserving human-human agreement evidence
- [x] Synthetic-only regression fixtures and protocol boundary documentation

P3 status: **READY FOR P4 COMMUNITY REVIEW SERVICE**. This does not mean that
the service exists, that real reviewers have qualified, that a batch has been
reviewed, or that any calibration or leaderboard claim is available.

### P4 Community Review Service — COMPLETE at deployment-ready boundary

- [x] P4-A isolated service/runtime boundary and private persistence model
- [x] P4-A PostgreSQL migration semantics, typed repository, and synthetic
      transaction/concurrency harness
- [x] P4-A authoritative qualification-receipt persistence boundary and
      positive-allowlist packet firewall
- [x] Authenticated issuer, consent, sealed qualification, and authoritative
      qualification receipts
- [x] Sealed blind assignment delivery, authenticated submission/withdrawal,
      close/freeze authority, and operational evidence boundaries
- [x] Deployment/readiness contract and private staging launch-gate evidence
- [x] Closed participation-application intake implementation and private staging gate
- [ ] Public participation application exposure and externally verified abuse controls
- [ ] Real reviewer campaign and fresh community evidence

P4 status: **COMMUNITY REVIEW SERVICE — PASS — DEPLOYMENT-READY**. Private
staging evidence does not open public reviewer intake or start a real campaign.

### L2-C2B Participation Application Contract / Closed-to-Open Gate — COMPLETE

- [x] Versioned, provider-independent application contract with strict runtime
      validation and bounded minimal fields
- [x] Applicant/contact data separation from opaque reviewer IDs, consent,
      qualification, assignments, submissions, and public evidence
- [x] Internal manual-review decision vocabulary without qualification claims
- [x] Fail-closed `CLOSED` / `OPEN` / `PAUSED` state model and hard 22-item
      `CLOSED -> OPEN` launch checklist
- [x] Public `/community/` transparency for future application categories

L2-C2B status: **APPLICATION CONTRACT DEFINED; PUBLIC APPLICATION NOT OPEN**.
No application form, persistence, endpoint, authentication, email delivery,
reviewer provisioning, or real applicant data is part of this phase.

### L2-C2C Closed Application Intake — COMPLETE

The state-gated application service, persistence boundary, idempotency,
withdrawal/redaction behavior, private staging dry run, and migration-recovery
evidence are complete at the closed boundary. Public application intake remains
not open. See the [application gate](community-review-application-gate.md) and
[staging gate](community-review-staging-gate.md).

### L2-C2D Public Exposure Hardening / Pre-Launch Gate — PARTIAL / BLOCKED

- [x] Direct-mode client-source boundary and explicit trusted-proxy model
- [x] Bounded transient application source-key derivation
- [x] Exact, disabled-by-default application CORS policy and strict preflight
- [x] Security/cache headers and ambiguous-header rejection
- [x] Operator/reviewer route isolation and closed-state behavior
- [x] Close/rollback boundary and exposure evidence record
- [x] Railway public-edge/platform DDOS capability read back separately from
      application abuse control
- [x] Railway WAF Under Attack availability and incident-only runbook recorded
- [x] L2-C2D-X architecture decision comparing Railway upgrade, external edge,
      current-risk acceptance, and distributed application limiting
- [ ] Approved external edge/CDN abuse control configured and verified

L2-C2D status: **APPLICATION PERIMETER HARDENED; PLATFORM DDOS VERIFIED; EDGE
RULES UNAVAILABLE ON CURRENT PLAN; WAF INCIDENT-ONLY; PUBLIC LAUNCH BLOCKED**.
`RAILWAY_EDGE_RATE_LIMIT = NOT AVAILABLE / NOT VERIFIED` and the approved
external application edge abuse control remains unverified.
`COMMUNITY_REVIEW_APPLICATION_INTAKE_STATE` must remain `CLOSED`,
`COMMUNITY_REVIEW_PUBLIC_INTAKE` must remain `false`, and launch authorization
#22 remains **NOT GIVEN**. See the [public exposure gate](community-review-public-exposure-gate.md)
and the [external abuse-control decision](community-review-edge-abuse-control-decision.md).

### L2-C3 Reviewer Portal — C3A COMPLETE / C3B-F PRIVATE STAGING PASS

- [x] L2-C3A invite-only Reviewer Portal architecture and browser
      authentication boundary
- [x] L2-C3B reviewer invitation, Auth0 token-channel, and backend authority
      contract (repository implementation)
- [ ] L2-C3C private portal shell and Authorization Code + PKCE authentication
      (repository shell implemented; provider activation and final Railway/browser
      evidence pending)
- [ ] L2-C3D consent and sealed qualification portal flow
- [ ] L2-C3E assignment, review, and submission portal flow
- [ ] L2-C3F private staging Reviewer Portal E2E

L2-C3A status: **PASS — architecture recorded**. L2-C3B-F status is
**PASS — the existing Auth0 Native operator channel and private staging
closure were verified** with the explicit Auth0 profile, client binding, and
`operator:review` scope. No reviewer-channel provider activation, real
reviewer provisioning, or invitation campaign has started. The C3C repository
shell is implemented, but C3C is not yet PASS until the separate provider
resources and final browser/deployment evidence are verified. See the [Reviewer
Portal architecture](community-review-reviewer-portal-architecture.md) and the
[C3B reviewer invitation gate](community-review-reviewer-invitation-gate.md).
This track does not open public application intake, public reviewer intake, or
the real Community Review campaign.

### Later Community Review phases — NOT STARTED

- [ ] P5 Community calibration
- [ ] P6 Verified model submission
- [ ] P7 Calibrated leaderboard
- [ ] P8 Video launch

## 0.5 Statistical Evaluation — NOT STARTED

- Repeated runs
- Variance and confidence intervals
- Significance analysis

## 0.6 Regression Gate — NOT STARTED

- Baseline comparison
- Thresholds
- CI artifacts

## 0.7 Human Evaluation — NOT STARTED

- Annotation guide
- Inter-rater agreement

## 0.8 Benchmark Release / Stabilization — NOT STARTED

## Finding-First Real-World Evaluation — INITIAL SLICE IMPLEMENTED; NOT VALIDATED

- [x] Additive, runtime-validated Scenario vNext, health-dimension, observation,
      evidence-reference, and Finding v1 contracts
- [x] 13 authored synthetic Productive Struggle & Intervention decision-point
      scenarios with a controlled multi-turn repeated-failure history

      weights and ERROR/unresolved handling
- [x] Architecture and claim-limit documentation
- [x] External design-partner Tutor Health CLI with explicit Tutor provenance,
      artifact output, Judge-provider reuse, and fail-closed no-Judge semantics
- [x] Private design-partner pilot boundary, Scenario Intake template, and
      stable runtime validation for caller-owned private Scenario vNext suites
- [ ] First real design-partner baseline -> product change -> rerun evidence loop
- [ ] Baseline/candidate regression comparison with new/resolved/persistent Findings
- [ ] Independent content review and human reliability evidence for the suite
- [ ] Calibrated confidence interpretation or validated weighting profiles
- [ ] Stateful multi-turn Tutor episode execution
- [ ] Any learner-outcome study or claim
- [ ] Dashboard or autonomous learner simulator

The `productive-struggle-intervention@0.1.0` profile and initial suite are
design artifacts. Their summary scores are descriptive and carry explicit
dimension and case-run coverage; this suite does not establish a complete
`core-tutor` profile, general tutor competence, learning effectiveness, or
WiseTutor policy.
